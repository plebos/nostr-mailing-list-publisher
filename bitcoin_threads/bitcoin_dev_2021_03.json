At its core, taproot is a way to make transactions with embedded smart contracts less expensive, done so in a manner that may marginally improve privacy dependent on user behavior (but not in the monero-like way you mention). For example, it makes it possible for lightning channels to look structurally similar to single key wallets, but it does nothing inherently to obfuscate the transaction graph as in monero.\n\nSuch \"monero-like\" transaction graph obfuscation may already exist in Bitcoin via other techniques (coinjoin, payjoin, coinswap, lightning, etc) with or without Taproot, so the point is further moot.\n\nDo you have a source on your reporting?\n\nYou may wish to rescind your nack.\n\n\n--\n@JeremyRubin<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin> <https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 27, 2021 at 5:46 AM LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH via bitcoin-dev < bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org<mailto:bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>> wrote:\nGood Afternoon,\n\nIt has been reported that Taproot will enable some Monero like features including the ability to hide transactions.\n\nIf that is the case I offer a full NACK and let me explain.\n\nA part of the benefit of using Bitcoin is its honesty.

If that were to change so that transactions may be obfuscated from scrutiny then any government would have unlimited impetus to ban Bitcoin, and speculation has that is the reason India has been reported to have banned cryptocurrencies already.\n\nI am in support of the expanded use case of Bitcoin without harming the established robust fairness and equal equity offered.

For the general public, how much you carry in your purse and where you get it from is none of their business. However, your employer is required to report to the government a record of pay, or at least maintain that record, and the store where you made a purchase similarly to keep records so that taxes can be paid. From their perspective, you do not need to know how much they keep in their drawer. Bitcoin directly allows your purse to be private and for the transaction ledger to take the scrutiny anyone should be able to apply to prove the ledger is honest. Maintaining an argument that consensus requires the ledger to be honest does not prove that it is honest.\n>\n> KING JAMES HRMH\n> Great British Empire\n>\n> Regards,\n> The Australian\n> LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH (& HMRH)\n> of Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire\n> MR.

SPV wallets are secure producing fully signed transactions. A ConJoin transaction signs for the UTXO and forwards it to be included signed for in another larger transaction with many inputs and outputs\n\nThe above point was not answered, so let me answer this for elucidation of you and any readers.\n\nA CoinJoin transaction is a single transaction with many inputs and many outputs.\n\nEvery input must be signed.\n\nWhen used to obfuscate, each input has different actual entities owning the coin.\n\nIn order to prevent fraud, it is necessary that what total amount each entity puts into the transaction, that entity also gets out (in freshly-generated addresses, which I hope you do not object to) as an output.\n\nWhen providing its signature, each entity verifies that its provided address exists in some output first before signing out its input.\n\nThe provided signature requires all the inputs and all the outputs to exist in the transaction.\nBecause of this, it is not possible to take a \"partial\" signature for this transaction, then change the transaction to redirect outputs elsewhere --- the signature of previous participants become invalid for the modified transaction..\n\nThus, the security of the CoinJoin cannot be damaged by a third party.\n\nThird parties involved in popular implementations of CoinJoin (such as the coordinator in Wasabi) are nothing more than clerical actuaries that take signatures of an immutable document, and any attempt by that clerical actuary to change the document also destroys any signatures of that document, making the modified document (the transaction) invalid.\n\n> . Also, none of those you mention is inherently a Privacy Technology. Transparency is one of the key articles of value in Bitcoin because it prevents fraud.\n\nThe prevention of fraud simply requires that all addition is validatable.\nIt does not require that the actual values involved are visible in cleartext.\n\nVarious cryptographic techniques already exist which allow the verifiable addition of encrypted values (\"homomorphisms\").\nYou can get 1 * G and 2 * G, add the resulting points, and compare it to 3 * G and see that you get the same point, yet if you did not know exactly what G was used, you would not know that you were checking the addition of 1 + 2 = 3.\nThat is the basis of a large number of privacy coins.\n\nAt the same time, if I wanted to *voluntarily* reveal this 1 + 2 = 3, I could reveal the numbers involved and the point G I used, and any validator (including, say, a government taxing authority) can check that the points recorded on the blockchain match with what I claimed.\n\nFor the prevention of fraud, we should strive to be as transparent as *little* as possible, while allowing users to *voluntarily* reveal information.\n\n\nRegards,\nZmnSCPxj"

Having previously made public disclosure of my affiliation with Jambler.io it seems sufficient to disclose my affiliation through the link in my email signature block.\n\nMy concern is not increased privacy it is maintaining consensus values and the transparency of the blockchain wherein all transactions are published in an immutable record and that forbids the redaction of information by any obfuscation. A separate concern is the availability of a privacy suitable for cash should a Bitcoin user desire and especially without disturbing the existing consensus.\n\nThe use of a Bitcoin Mixer is to enable standard equivalent privacy. As you may experience yourself, you do not allow people to follow you around looking in your purse, suppose you are dealing entirely with cash, and to see where and how much you fill it up, and where you spend. Nonetheless, for an honest person, their wallet is available for government audit as are their financial affairs. This is consistent with the existing operation of consensus.\n\nMy full email signature block is a disclosure where I have some affiliation with the referenced website being that it carries at least some information that I have provided or that in some way I am associated perhaps only making use of their services. For example, I hardly make a profit from LinkedIn just my information is there. Also, I have made previous public disclosure of the affiliation.

While it may seem lucrative at first I insist all partner profits are reportable on your personal income.\nhttps://jambler.io/become-partner.php\n\nI am certainly better than confident that you appreciate the difference between an open and transparent blockchain and the ability of the user to not reveal details of the content of their wallet publicly.\n\nIf further clarification is required may I suggest you pay a token and mix some Bitcoin wherein our discussion may then have some point of reference.\n\nKING JAMES HRMH\nGreat British Empire\n\nRegards,\nThe Australian\nLORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH (& HMRH)\nof Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire\nMR.

At its core, taproot is a way to make transactions with embedded smart contracts less expensive, done so in a manner that may marginally improve privacy dependent on user behavior (but not in the monero-like way you mention). For example, it makes it possible for lightning channels to look structurally similar to single key wallets, but it does nothing inherently to obfuscate the transaction graph as in monero.\n\nSuch \"monero-like\" transaction graph obfuscation may already exist in Bitcoin via other techniques (coinjoin, payjoin, coinswap, lightning, etc) with or without Taproot, so the point is further moot.\n\nDo you have a source on your reporting?\n\nYou may wish to rescind your nack.\n\n\n--\n@JeremyRubin<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin> <https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 27, 2021 at 5:46 AM LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH via bitcoin-dev < bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org<mailto:bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>> wrote:\nGood Afternoon,\n\nIt has been reported that Taproot will enable some Monero like features including the ability to hide transactions.\n\nIf that is the case I offer a full NACK and let me explain.\n\nA part of the benefit of using Bitcoin is its honesty.

The basic principle of Bitcoin it all transactions are published to the public ledger, the blockchain. What is valuable is the system that consensus enshrines as we have it, not what it may become tomorrow. If ther eis not consensus then there is no Bitcoin, there is a scattering of alt-coins one of which may retain the Bitcoin name and BTC lookup but without consensus it is not what is valued by the current consensus. Consensus is exactly why Bitcoin is pushing AU$70K again last night because we agree it has value, and BCH is less than AU$700 - that is why it is important to defend consensus, those who disagree are free to do what they want, mostly, elsewhere. We have agreed Bitcoin has certain properties including being immutable, transparent, publicly published. Consensus provides we make software to operate in accordance with consensus. If we do not value Bitcoin to defend consensus, instead preferring to have the product exhibit our own mistrust or flaws, then go play with BCH and make it like DOGE, they will klike you at DOGE.\n\nEric, you are intelligent, obviously, but you mistake from you other email the tenet of honset for the actual case of honesty. The ledger is not ascertained to be honest until it can be proven when it is checked, the very reason for publishing to the public blockchain without obfuscation, and one of the actual reasons Bitcoin has inherent value. The value is agreed in an exchange, yet without the properties of the consensus that value is lost.\n\nKING JAMES HRMH\nGreat British Empire\n\nRegards,\nThe Australian\nLORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH (& HMRH)\nof Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire\nMR.

For example, it makes it possible for lightning channels to look structurally similar to single key wallets, but it does nothing inherently to obfuscate the transaction graph as in monero.\n\n\n\nSuch \"monero-like\" transaction graph obfuscation may already exist in Bitcoin via other techniques (coinjoin, payjoin, coinswap, lightning, etc) with or without Taproot, so the point is further moot.\n\n\n\nDo you have a source on your reporting?\n\n\n\nYou may wish to rescind your nack.\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n@JeremyRubin<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 27, 2021 at 5:46 AM LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH via bitcoin-dev < bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org<mailto:bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>> wrote:\n\nGood Afternoon,\n\n\n\nIt has been reported that Taproot will enable some Monero like features including the ability to hide transactions.\n\n\n\nIf that is the case I offer a full NACK and let me explain.\n\n\n\nA part of the benefit of using Bitcoin is its honesty.

I can't tell since you failed to disclose your relationship with the mixer.\n\nCould you please clarify your association with the bitcoin mixer and moving forward could you please always do proper disclosure any time you're publically talking about bitcoin transaction privacy. It's only fair to do so as to not mislead people in an attempt to manipulate at worst and just a courteous practice at best.\n\nCheers\nAriel Lorenzo-Luaces\nOn Feb 28, 2021, at 4:36 AM, LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH via bitcoin-dev <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org<mailto:bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>> wrote:\nGood Evening,\n\nThank-you for your advice  @JeremyRubin<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>  on the basis you advise, \"Taproot does not enable monero-like privacy features\", I am prepred to withdraw my NACK notably that the existing feeatures of Bitcoin MUST be maintained, and whereby the UTXO of a transaction is identifiable, the PayTo Address, and the amount all without any obfuscation.\n\nLightning does not really provide obfuscation, it provides a result of a subset of transactions although the operation of the channel is observable to the parties.\n\nThe reports I were reading concerning the supposed operation of Taproot published in a public media channel may have been speculation or misinformation nonetheless it is prudent to conditionally reply as you see that I have.

At its core, taproot is a way to make transactions with embedded smart contracts less expensive, done so in a manner that may marginally improve privacy dependent on user behavior (but not in the monero-like way you mention). For example, it makes it possible for lightning channels to look structurally similar to single key wallets, but it does nothing inherently to obfuscate the transaction graph as in monero.\n\nSuch \"monero-like\" transaction graph obfuscation may already exist in Bitcoin via other techniques (coinjoin, payjoin, coinswap, lightning, etc) with or without Taproot, so the point is further moot.\n\nDo you have a source on your reporting?\n\nYou may wish to rescind your nack.\n\n\n--\n@JeremyRubin<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin><https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 27, 2021 at 5:46 AM LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH via bitcoin-dev <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org<mailto:bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>> wrote:\nGood Afternoon,\n\nIt has been reported that Taproot will enable some Monero like features including the ability to hide transactions.\n\nIf that is the case I offer a full NACK and let me explain.\n\nA part of the benefit of using Bitcoin is its honesty. The full transaction is published on the blockchain. If that were to change so that transactions may be obfuscated from scrutiny then any government would have unlimited impetus to ban Bitcoin, and speculation has that is the reason India has been reported to have banned cryptocurrencies already.\n\nI am in support of the expanded use case of Bitcoin without harming the established robust fairness and equal equity offered.

The minority will be at the mercy of massive PoW swings and the chain will lose friends so it's not good for anyone. I recommend changing the final percentage to %50 because that's the hurdle where non-upgraded users *must* activate to avoid the risk of being reorged.

(Or, alternatively, that an approach like Matt suggests in\n\"Straight Flag Day (Height)\" is used, and there is no early-activation\nvia hashpower supermajority option)\n\nSo under that scenario you reach the timeout, but without activation\noccurring. You also don't have any \"reasonable, directed objection\":\neveryone who could provide a reasonable objection is under NDA.\n\nWhat's the scenario look like if you say \"signalling doesn't matter,\nthe software enforces the consensus rules\"?\n\nI think it'll be obvious there'll be two sets of software out there and\nsupported and following a single chain; one set that enforces the new\nrules, and one set that doesn't, just as we had Bitcoin Unlimited back\nin the day. For at least a while, it will be safe to do spends protected\nby the new rules, because one set of nodes will enforce them, and any\nminers running the other software won't want see it in their mempool,\nand won't want to risk manually mining non-compliant transactions in case\nit turns out they're in the minority -- just as Bitcoin Unlimited miners\ndidn't actually attempt to mine big blocks on mainnet back in the day.\n\nSo for a while, we have two divergent sets of maintained node software\nfollowing the same chain, with advocates of both claiming that they're the\nmajority. Some people will beleive the people claiming the new rules are\nsafe, and commit funds to them, and as those funds are demonstrably not\nstolen, the number of people thinking it's safe will gradually increase\n-- presumably the new rules have some benefit other than to the patent\nholder, after all.\n\nEventually the patent gets revealed, though, just as covert ASICBoost\ndid. Either NDA's expire, something violates them, someone rediscovers\nor reverse-engineers the idea, or the patent holder decides it's time\nto start either suing competitors or advertising.\n\nWhat happens at that point? We have two sets of node software that both\nclaim to have been in the majority, and one of which is clearly better\nfor decentralisation.\n\nBut if we all just switch to that two things happen: we allow miners to\nsteal the funds that users entrusted to the new rules, and anyone who\nwas enforcing the new rules but is not following the day-to-day drama\nhas a hard-fork event and can no longer follow the main chain until the\nfind new software to run.\n\nAlternatively, do we all switch to software that protects users funds\nand avoids hard-fork events, even though that software is bad for\ndecentralisation, and do we do that precisely when the people who were\nadvocating against using that software have just been proven to have\nbeen right all along?\n\nIn my opinion, while the first choice would be horrible, the second\nchoice is completely at odds with human nature, so I think we'd end\nup making the horrible choice, and so should avoid getting into that\nscenario in the first place.\n\nThere's two ways we could avoid it: one is by not making changes any\ntime there's the possibility of good reasons to be against something:\nso in the above, in an ideal world, we might have to delay activation\nuntil any potential NDAs will expire.\n\nI'm not convinced that level of patience is really plausible either\nthough: when covert ASICBoost became widely known, that was a \"reasonable,\ndirected objection\" to segwit -- it made real mining hardware less\nefficient. We could have halted segwit deployment at that point and\nchanged the spec so that it didn't prevent covert ASICBoost -- eg, sorting\nthe wtxids prior to calculating the witness commitment would have made\nsegwit compatible with ASICBoost without a large impact in any other way,\nand started again, perhaps with a BIP-91-alike to forbid miners signalling\nfor segwit so that we could begin a second activation attempt sooner.\n\nBut we didn't do anything like that; instead we got segwit activated\nfollowing the existing plan, and ended up with a hard-forked chain\nsplit in the form of BCH. I'd suggested a lighter weight compromise to\nsome folks in early June 2017, to which one of the response was \"The\ntime for this soft of ASICBoost compromise would have been right after\nScaling Bitcoin HK, when the mining hardware manufacturers realized the\nunintentional effects of segwit on their hardware. But that door has long\nsince closed and at this point this proposal smells of appeasement.\" and\nI think that ended up being a pretty accurate take.\n\nThe other way of avoiding that horrible scenario is committing to the\nactivation on-chain. That is, if the chain history satisfies property X,\nenforce the new rules; if it does not satisify that property, don't\nenforce the rules. That avoids the ambiguity: whether the new rules\nare active becomes a matter of history, not subject to ongoing debate\nand political posturing.\n\nIn the above scenario, where no one is able to discover/explain the actual\nproblems with the soft-fork before it activates, activation by signalling\nmeans it likely activates unambiguously (because the opposition does not\nseem reasonable), and once the problems are known they have to be dealt\nwith directly, there's no option to just pretend it never happened (and\nthat it's therefore fine to steal any funds from people who thought it\nwas able to be relied upon). That's much the same as how we've attempted\nto fix problems with p2sh in segwit or taproot.\n\n\n\nOther failure modes are possible too. \n\nOne is if only a small number of rabid advocates run the code enforcing\nthe flag day, and someone calls their bluff -- if you're excluding that\nfailure case because \"oh, but if core does it, plenty of people will\nrun the enforcing code\" then you're assuming the market will just do\nwhatever the dev's say, and that devs are willing to test that assumption.\n\nAnother is if people factor in the above scenario and decide that if\nthere's any ongoing controversy they won't use the new soft fork's rules\n-- if there's a chance everyone will switch over to the non-enforcing\nsoftware, why take the risk? But that allows you to prevent a soft-fork\nfrom getting any adoption simply by maintaining an alternative client,\nand hiring sock puppets to create controversy.\n\n\n\nAnother thing to consider is that it probably makes sense to support\n\"user-prohibited soft-forks\" in a similar way to \"user-activated\nsoft-forks\". Saying \"it's active if and only if there's signalling\"\nmoves this action to whether you're required/prohibited from signalling,\nwhich is fairly straightforward, with easy to analyse results. If you\nmake it be \"just do/don't enforce the rules\", then a user-prohibited\nsoft-fork following the same scheme seems like it would be very uncertain.\n\nCheers,\naj"

                "message_text_only": "It's becoming increasingly clear that core might not be able to release activation code.\n\nAnyone advocating for a UASF must do tremendous amounts of work to convince users, miners, and service providers to run a UASF client. Anyone advocating against a UASF or indifferent will take the path of least resistance and ignore the rogue client. If the movement fails to materialize we will be looking at a minor chain split one year later and a year of wasted time. At that moment LOT=false can be finally released and calmer heads can activate on the majority chain.\n\nThe choice has never been LOT=false versus LOT=true. It has always been about the order. Some think LOT=true should be attempted first and some think LOT=false should be attempted first. And the grand majority are indifferent to the choice (won't upgrade until core says it's safe).\n\nI'm realizing that a clear advantage of LOT=false is that it can happen without the need for a social movement. All that is really needed is the convincing of 95% miners. Apathetic users will never notice any kind of service disruption no matter the success or failure of the activation. This is obviously why it naturally became the default activation method.\n\nWhile LOT=true, on the other hand, must be able to 51% the blockchain to win the apathetic users. But then the reorgs will not be pretty. Or if it ever clearly gets over the 51% hurdle then all apathetic users now need to scramble to use the rogue client to be safe from reorgs. Either way it's disruptive.\n\nPlease, I'm begging you, let's just try LOT=false first. Let's halt the fight for this new UASF movement until it's needed. Social movements are hard. Especially hard when the people you're trying to convince don't have a material threat to their beliefs or freedoms. It would be a shame to meet back here a year later after the risk of verbal conflicts, misdirection, lies, vilinization, reorgs, double spends, PoW changes, and threats galore.\n\nP.S. I don't think I'm being so apocalyptic this time. I actually see all of those things as *necessary* to the UASF movement. Otherwise people won't be convinced to take a side.\n\nCheers\nAriel Lorenzo-Luaces\n\n\nOn Mar 1, 2021, 1:06 PM, at 1:06 PM, Michael Folkson via bitcoin-dev <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n>It is approximately 8 months since Steve Lee formally kicked off the\n>Taproot activation discussion by setting up the ##taproot-activation\n>IRC channel.

It could lead to nodes\npartitioning themselves from one another, but I am uncertain of the\nparticulars of invalidate block's relationship to DoS rules.\n\nTherefore it may be a harm reduction, should core release with LOT=false,\nto have opt-in configurability natively. Configurability is superior to a\nsituation where, near to the timeout with LOT=true seeming more likely,\nusers unable to switch binaries reach for such a convenience script.\n\nThe counterargument would be that running a script is still a hoop to jump\nthrough more difficult than a config flag and we don't want user's choosing\nconsensus rules via config flags.

                "message_text_only": "Hi Suhas,\n\nThank you for this proposal. I agree with your aims, but I think a new\nP2P message isn't necessary to achieve them.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThere are two distinct (but interacting) motivations:\n\n1. Allow a node to accept more incoming connections which will only be\n   used for block propagation (no transaction relay or addr gossip),\n   while minimizing resource requirements.\n\n2. Prevent `addr` gossip messages from being sent to peers which will\n   'black hole' those addrs (i.e. not relay them further).\n\nThese motivations interact because if we simply increase the number of\nblock-relay-only connections that nodes make without making any\nallowance for the fact those connections won't gossip addr records, then\nwe'll increase the number of addr black holes and worsen addr gossip.\n\n# Using fRelay=false to signal no transaction relay.\n\n`fRelay` is an optional field in the `version` message. There are three\nBIPs concerned with `fRelay`:\n\n- BIP 37[1] introduced the `fRelay` field to indicate to the recipient\n  that they must not relay transactions over the connection until a\n  `filteradd` message has been received.\n\n- BIP 60[2] aimed to make the `fRelay` field mandatory. It is not clear\n  how widely this BIP has been adopted by implementations.\n\n- BIP 111[3] introduced a `NODE_BLOOM` service bit to indicate that\n  bloom filters are served by this node. According to this BIP, \"If a\n  node does not support bloom filters but receives a \"filterload\",\n  \"filteradd\", or \"filterclear\" message from a peer the node should\n  disconnect that peer immediately.\"\n\nWithin Bitcoin Core:\n\n- PR 1795[4] (merged in January 2013) added support for BIP 37 Bloom\n  filters.\n\n- Since PR 2763[5] (merged in June 2013), Bitcoin Core will _always_\n  include the `fRelay` flag in `version` messages that it sends. Bitcoin\n  Core will tolerate the `fRelay` field being present or absent in any\n  `version` message that it receives[6].\n\n- PR 6579[7] (merged in August 2015) implemented BIP 111. From that\n  point on, a Bitcoin Core node would disconnect peers that sent it\n  `filter*` messages if it hadn't enabled `NODE_BLOOM`, provided the\n  peer's version was >= 70011. In PR 7708[8] (merged in March 2016) this\n  was extended to disconnect any peer that sends a `filter*` message,\n  regardless of its version (in general, a 'polite disconnect' for any\n  peer that requests an unsupported service is probably the best\n  behaviour). In PR 16152[9] (merged in July 2019), serving Bloom\n  filters was disabled by default, due to potential denial-of-service\n  attacks being possible against nodes which serve bloom filters on\n  public connections.\n\n- PR 6993[10] (merged in November 2015) started reusing the `fRelay`\n  field for the new `-blocksonly` mode. If Bitcoin Core is started with\n  `-blocksonly` configured, then it includes `fRelay=false` in all of\n  the `version` messages it sends. In PR 15759[11] (merged  in September\n  2019), this usage of `fRelay` to permanently disable tx relay was\n  extended for use by the new block-relay only connection type.\n\nThe net effect is that `fRelay` is already being used to indicate that\ntransactions should not be relayed over a connection. In the motivation\nfor your BIP, you write:\n\n> The low-bandwidth / minimal-resource nature of these connections is\n> currently known only by the initiator of the connection; this is\n> because the transaction relay field in the version message is not a\n> permanent setting for the lifetime of the connection.  Consequently, a\n> node receiving an inbound connection with transaction relay disabled\n> cannot distinguish between a peer that will never enable transaction\n> relay (as described in BIP 37) and one that will...\n\nHowever, as AJ points out in his response [12], the Bitcoin Core node\n_does_ know whether transaction relay can be supported as soon as the\n`version` message is received:\n\n> [...] you either set m_tx_relay->fRelayTxes to true via the VERSION\n> message (either explicitly or by not setting fRelay), or you enable it\n> later with FILTERLOAD or FILTERCLEAR, both of which will cause a\n> disconnect if bloom filters aren't supported. Bloom filter support is\n> (optionally?) indicated via a service bit (BIP 111), so you could\n> assume you know whether they're supported as soon as you receive the\n> VERSION line.\n\ni.e. if Bitcoin Core node is running under normal configuration with\nbloom filters disabled for public connections (which is both the default\nsetting and highly recommended due to DoS concerns), then as soon as it\nreceives a `version` message with `fRelay=false`, it can be sure that\nthere will never be any transaction relay with that peer. If the peer\nlater tries to enable transaction relay by sending a `filterload`\nmessage, then the node will disconnect that peer immediately.\n\nIn summary, we can continue using the `fRelay` field to indicate that\nno transaction relay can happen for the entire lifetime of the\nconnection.  Bitcoin Core can postpone allocating resources for\ntransaction relay data structures until after the version message has\nbeen received to minimize resource usage for incoming block-relay-only\nconnections. A rough implementation is here[13]. Obviously, a node that\nhas been configured to serve bloom filters on public connections would\nnot be able to take advantage of this and accept additional incoming\nblock-relay-only peers, but I think that's fine - we already discourage\nthat configuration.\n\nI think a good counter-argument against simply using `fRelay` for this\npurpose is that we shouldn't reuse a protocol feature designed for one\nfunction to achieve a totally different aim. However, we know that nodes\non the network have been using `fRelay` to disable transaction relay\nsince Bitcoin Core version 0.12 (when `-blocksonly` was added), and that\nusage was expanded to _all_ nodes running Bitcoin Core version 0.19 or\nlater (when block-relay-only connections were introduced), so using\n`fRelay` to disable transaction relay is now de facto part of the p2p\nprotocol.\n\n# Preventing addr black holes\n\nAddresses of potential peers are gossiped around the p2p network using\n`addr` messages. When a Bitcoin Core node learns of a new `addr` record,\nit will relay that record to one or two of its peers, chosen at\nrandom[14]. The idea is that eventually the `addr` record will reach\nmost of the nodes on the network.\n\nIf there are too many nodes on the network that receive `addr` records\nand do not relay those records on to their peers (termed _addr black\nhole_ nodes), then propagation of those `addr` records suffers -- any\nindividual `addr` record is unlikely to reach a large proportion of\nnodes on the network.\n\nSince a motivation for block-relay-only connections is to protect\nagainst eclipse attacks and thwart network topology analysis, Bitcoin\nCore will not relay `addr` records on those connections, and will ignore\nany `addr` record received over those connections. Therefore, increasing\nthe number of block-relay-only connections without changing the `addr`\ngossip logic is likely to increase the prevalence of addr black holes,\nand negatively impact addr propagation. This is why BIP 338 includes:\n\n> It is RECOMMENDED that a node that has sent or received a disabletx\n> message to/from a peer not send any of these messages to the peer:\n>\n> - addr/getaddr\n> - addrv2 (BIP 155)\n\nI think a better approach would be for Bitcoin Core to only relay addr\nrecords to an inbound peer if it has previously received an `addr` or\n`addrv2` message from that peer, since that indicates definitively that\nthe peer actively gossips `addr` records. This approach was first\nsuggested by AJ in the original block-relay-only PR[15].\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that it will improve addr propagation\nimmediately and without any change to the P2P protocol, and will prevent\nsending `addr` records to all addr black holes (such as light clients),\nnot just incoming block-relay-only connections.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe can increase the permitted number of inbound block-relay-only peers\nwhile minimizing resource requirement _and_ improving addr record\npropagation, without any changes to the p2p protocol required.\n\nI propose that for Bitcoin Core version 22.0:\n\n- only initialize the transaction relay data structures after the\n  `version` message is received, and only if fRelay=true and\n  `NODE_BLOOM` is not offered on this connection.\n- only initialize the addr data structures for inbound connections when\n  an `addr`, `addrv2` or `getaddr` message is received on the\n  connection, and only consider a connection for addr relay if its addr\n  data structures are initialized.\n- update the inbound eviction logic to protect more inbound peers which\n  do not have transaction relay data structures.\n\nThen, in version 23.0:\n\n- modestly increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections.\n\nJohn\n\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki\n[2] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0060.mediawiki\n[3] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0111.mediawiki\n[4] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1795\n[5] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2763\n[6]\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e49117470b77fb7d53be122c6490ba163c6e304d/src/net_processing.cpp#L2582-L2583\n[7] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6579\n[8] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7708\n[9] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16152\n[10] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6993\n[11] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759\n[12]\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-January/018347.html\n[13] https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2021-02-lazy-init-peer\n[14]\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e52ce9f2b312b3cf3b0837918e07d7603e241d63/src/net_processing.cpp#L1696-L1700\n[15] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-527012757\n\n> Hi,\n>\n> I'm proposing the addition of a new, optional p2p message to allow peers\nto communicate that they do not want to send or receive (loose)\ntransactions for the lifetime of a connection.\n>\n> The goal of this message is to help facilitate connections on the network\nover which only block-related data (blocks/headers/compact blocks/etc) are\nrelayed, to create low-resource connections that help protect against\npartition attacks on the network.

To understand tx-relay\nopt-out from peers correctly, a _non_ Bitcoin Core client has to implement\nthe `fRelay` subset of BIP37, but ignore the wider part around FILTER*\nmessages. Or implement those messages, only to disconnect peers sending\nthem, thus following BIP111 requirements.\n\nThus, future developers of bitcoin software have the choice between\nimplementing a standard in a non-compliant way or implementing p2p messages\nfor a light client protocol in a way of deprecation ? Even further, an\ninterpretation of BIP 37 (\"Being able to opt-out of _inv_ messages until\nthe filter is set prevents a client being flooded with traffic in the brief\nwindow of time\") would make it okay to send TX messages to your inbound\nblock-relay-only peers. And that your client shouldn't be disconnected for\nsuch behavior.\n\nOn the long-term, IMHO, better to have a well-defined standard with a clean\nnegotiation mechanism rather than relying on code specifics of a given\nBitcoin client. If we don't want to introduce a new message and\ncorresponding code changes, it would be wise at least to extract VERSION's\n`fRelay` and how Core handles it in its own BIP.\n\n> I think a better approach would be for Bitcoin Core to only relay addr\n> records to an inbound peer if it has previously received an `addr` or\n> `addrv2` message from that peer, since that indicates definitively that\n> the peer actively gossips `addr` records. This approach was first\n> suggested by AJ in the original block-relay-only PR[15].\n\nIf a node is willingly to opt-out from addr-relay from one of its inbound\npeers, how is it supposed to do ? Of course, you can drop such messages on\nthe floor, your peer is just going to waste bandwidth for nothing. IIRC\nfrom past irc p2p meetings, we're really unclear about what a\ngood-propagation-and-privacy-preserving addr-relay strategy should look\nlike. Note, that distrusting your inbound peers with your addr-relay might\nbe a sane direction. Explicit addr-relay negotiation will offer more\nflexibility (and more hygienic code paths rather than triggering data\nstructures initialization in few different locations).\n\n> - update the inbound eviction logic to protect more inbound peers which\n> do not have transaction relay data structures.\n\nGiven inbound connections might be attacker-controlled and tx-relay opt-out\nsignaling is also attacker-controlled, wouldn't this give a bias toward an\nattacker in occupying our inbound slots ? Compared to honest inbound peers,\nwhich in average are going to be full-relay.\n\nCheers,\nAntoine\n\n\n\nLe lun. 1 mars 2021 \u00e0 16:07, John Newbery via bitcoin-dev <\nbitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> a \u00e9crit :\n\n> Hi Suhas,\n>\n> Thank you for this proposal. I agree with your aims, but I think a new\n> P2P message isn't necessary to achieve them.\n>\n> # Motivation\n>\n> There are two distinct (but interacting) motivations:\n>\n> 1. Allow a node to accept more incoming connections which will only be\n>    used for block propagation (no transaction relay or addr gossip),\n>    while minimizing resource requirements.\n>\n> 2. Prevent `addr` gossip messages from being sent to peers which will\n>    'black hole' those addrs (i.e. not relay them further).\n>\n> These motivations interact because if we simply increase the number of\n> block-relay-only connections that nodes make without making any\n> allowance for the fact those connections won't gossip addr records, then\n> we'll increase the number of addr black holes and worsen addr gossip.\n>\n> # Using fRelay=false to signal no transaction relay.\n>\n> `fRelay` is an optional field in the `version` message. There are three\n> BIPs concerned with `fRelay`:\n>\n> - BIP 37[1] introduced the `fRelay` field to indicate to the recipient\n>   that they must not relay transactions over the connection until a\n>   `filteradd` message has been received.\n>\n> - BIP 60[2] aimed to make the `fRelay` field mandatory. It is not clear\n>   how widely this BIP has been adopted by implementations.\n>\n> - BIP 111[3] introduced a `NODE_BLOOM` service bit to indicate that\n>   bloom filters are served by this node. According to this BIP, \"If a\n>   node does not support bloom filters but receives a \"filterload\",\n>   \"filteradd\", or \"filterclear\" message from a peer the node should\n>   disconnect that peer immediately.\"\n>\n> Within Bitcoin Core:\n>\n> - PR 1795[4] (merged in January 2013) added support for BIP 37 Bloom\n>   filters.\n>\n> - Since PR 2763[5] (merged in June 2013), Bitcoin Core will _always_\n>   include the `fRelay` flag in `version` messages that it sends. Bitcoin\n>   Core will tolerate the `fRelay` field being present or absent in any\n>   `version` message that it receives[6].\n>\n> - PR 6579[7] (merged in August 2015) implemented BIP 111. From that\n>   point on, a Bitcoin Core node would disconnect peers that sent it\n>   `filter*` messages if it hadn't enabled `NODE_BLOOM`, provided the\n>   peer's version was >= 70011. In PR 7708[8] (merged in March 2016) this\n>   was extended to disconnect any peer that sends a `filter*` message,\n>   regardless of its version (in general, a 'polite disconnect' for any\n>   peer that requests an unsupported service is probably the best\n>   behaviour). In PR 16152[9] (merged in July 2019), serving Bloom\n>   filters was disabled by default, due to potential denial-of-service\n>   attacks being possible against nodes which serve bloom filters on\n>   public connections.\n>\n> - PR 6993[10] (merged in November 2015) started reusing the `fRelay`\n>   field for the new `-blocksonly` mode. If Bitcoin Core is started with\n>   `-blocksonly` configured, then it includes `fRelay=false` in all of\n>   the `version` messages it sends. In PR 15759[11] (merged  in September\n>   2019), this usage of `fRelay` to permanently disable tx relay was\n>   extended for use by the new block-relay only connection type.\n>\n> The net effect is that `fRelay` is already being used to indicate that\n> transactions should not be relayed over a connection. In the motivation\n> for your BIP, you write:\n>\n> > The low-bandwidth / minimal-resource nature of these connections is\n> > currently known only by the initiator of the connection; this is\n> > because the transaction relay field in the version message is not a\n> > permanent setting for the lifetime of the connection.

I think\nBIP 60 is as much unclear as BIP37 \"Whether the remote peer should announce\nrelayed transactions or not, see BIP 0037, since version >= 70001\". A first\ninterpretation could be that all tx-relay messages are disabled. A second\ninterpretation could be that only _tx-announcement_ messages (e.g INV(TX))\nare disabled.\n\nIt could be argued that #15759 introduced incompatible changes between a\nBitcon Core 0.19.0 node and a BIP37 compliant peer on the p2p network.\nPost-15759, the message space allowed to a BIP37 peer has been\nreduced...Note that BIP60 isn't listed as implemented in\nbitcoin/doc/bips.md.\n\nI believe that BIP338 has the merit of making those subjects clear and easy\nto follow by any Bitcoin software. Instead of spawning discussion around\nold, lightclient-related BIPs or Core undocumented disabling transaction\nrelay mechanism being de facto part of the p2p protocol.\n\n> Sorry - I meant that Bitcoin Core should allow a certain number of\n> inbound peers that do not relay txs. This would be in addition to the\n> full-relay inbound peers.\n\nYes, I agree on the purpose. But I don't think we need to \"allow\" further\ndisabled-tx peers by our inbound connection selection or eviction logics.\nTurning a few bits in a protocol message sounds a too-cheap burden on\npotential attackers contrary to most of our current eviction heuristics,\nforcing some work (\"announce transaction fast, \"be located in some subnet\",\n\"announce block fast\"). Though better to discuss this later, not the main\npoint of your proposal.\n\nAntoine\n\nLe mar. 2 mars 2021 \u00e0 07:22, John Newbery via bitcoin-dev <\nbitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> a \u00e9crit :\n\n> Antoine,\n>\n> Nothing in my proposal below precludes introducing a more comprehensive\n> feature negotiation mechanism at some later date.

(It doesn\u2019t, it just makes it a dying, decaying\none).\n\nWe have a trillion dollar industry (all signed up to this upgrade)\nwasting time monitoring these arguments rather than preparing for an\nupgrade and preparing for the small but manageable risks that any such\nupgrade entails later in the year. Development projects on hold\nbecause there is no end in sight for Taproot activation.\n\nWe need to give miners and users the ability to activate this year\n(2021). If we fail to do that through whatever means (Core, UASF\nrelease) etc I personally will assume Taproot will never activate. I\nwill also assume Bitcoin is not a project for the incredibly able\npeople who have designed and shipped a complex upgrade (Taproot) that\nmiraculously has overwhelming consensus amongst the entire community.\nFailing to ship activation code (a very small code change in\ncomparison) is a joke.\n\nWe need to get this done this year. A UASF (LOT=true) project needs to\nbe ready to assemble just like it was in 2017 to make sure a small\ngroup of individuals don\u2019t block progress. But Core also needs to be\ngiven the opportunity to ship a BIP 8(1 year, LOT=false) activation\nthat can be used to activate this year that is as well reviewed and\nwell tested as any other Core consensus code change.\n\nOnce things have calmed down I think we should revisit what progress\nhas been made and take it from there.\n\n-- \nMichael Folkson\nEmail: michaelfolkson at gmail.com\nKeybase: michaelfolkson\nPGP: 43ED C999 9F85 1D40 EAF4 9835 92D6 0159 214C FEE3"

A quick UASF fork allows for an early LOT=false\nactivation.\n\nI think you misunderstand BIP 8 (LOT=true). Although no timetable has been\nfinalized as of yet (and hence we are in the realm of speculation rather\nthan facts), the earliest the MUST_SIGNAL period would kick in is around\nJuly 2022. That doesn't sound very quick to me if you seek a LOT=false\nrelease after a LOT=true release has failed to activate.\n\n> The current risk to taproot and all future activations is a loud minority\nof users who are threatening to co-opt a LOT=false activation by switching\nthe parameter\n\nAs I've said in previous emails to this list, some people are determined to\nignore the discussion and (open to all) meetings of recent weeks and block\nprogress until they find their philosopher's stone. They seek to ignore all\nthe work people have done laying out the options, communicating those\noptions to the community and narrowing them down. Instead they bring up\nalternative proposals which were discussed and rejected weeks or months\nago. With this mindset we'll still be arguing about Taproot activation in\n2030.\n\nI get that there isn't overwhelming consensus on the LOT parameter, this is\na fact. But there won't be overwhelming consensus on any activation\nmechanism, that has become clear. I am of the view that consensus on one\nparameter of an activation mechanism does not need to be as high as it is\non the actual soft fork that is being activated (which does have\noverwhelming consensus). And of course if and when a LOT=true (UASF)\nversion is released you are absolutely free not to run it. I hope (and\nsuspect) you would reconsider if July 2022 (or later) was approaching and\nit was the only way to activate Taproot.\n\nThanks\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 4, 2021 at 2:18 AM Ariel Luaces <arielluaces at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> On Wed, Mar 3, 2021 at 12:25 PM Michael Folkson via bitcoin-dev\n> <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> >\n> > At this point in time it also appears the greatest risk to Taproot\n> > dying a slow death is a small group of developers who think talking in\n> > conservative tones and talking about endless philosophy makes Bitcoin\n> > a conservative system.

From the point of view of a miner or big\nexchange stuck in the middle, if they look at the ecosystem of twitter\nand reddit (especially if you think about all the problems with bots and\nsockpuppets) they have no idea which consensus rules they should\nactually follow and exactly what date they take effect. Miners,\nexchanges, merchants and the rest of the ecosystem exist to serve their\ncustomers and users, and trouble happens when they don't know what their\ncustomers really want. Social media attacks are not just a theoretical\nconcern; back during the block size drama, the bitcoin reddits were\ntargetted by bots, sockpuppets and brigading[3].\n\nEnter flag day activation. With a flag day there can be no\nbrinksmanship. A social media blitz cant do anything except have its own\nfollowers fork away. Crucially, miner signalling cant be used to change\nthe activation date for nodes that didn't choose to and just passively\nfollow signalling. Changing the activation date requires all those users\nto actually run different node software.\n\nFlag day activation works simply: we choose a block height and after\nthat block height the new taproot rules become enforced.\n\n\nSupporters of the permissionless, \"users rule\" approach of LOT=true\nshould be happy because it completely takes miners out of activation.\n\nSupporters of the safe, conservative approach of LOT=false can be made\nhappy with a few ways of derisking:\n\n* Getting mining pools, businesses and users to look at the code and ask\nif they (a) think its either neutral or good for their business or use\ncase and (b) they believe others view it similarly and that the\nconsensus changes proposed have a good social consensus around them.\n\n* Setting the flag day far in the future (18 months or 2 years in the\noriginal proposal[3]).\n\n\n== What if flag day activation is used maliciously? ==\n\nWhat if one day the Core developer team is co-opted and uses the flag\nday method to do something bad? For example, a soft fork where sending\nto certain blacklisted addresses is not allowed. The bitcoin user\ncommunity who wants to resist this can create their own\ncounter-soft-fork full node, where the first block after the flag day\nMUST pay to one of those addresses on the blacklist. This forces a chain\nsplit between the censorship rules and the no-censorship rules, and its\npretty obvious that the real bitcoin which most people follow will be\nthe chain without censorship.\n\nFor example, if a group of users didn't agree with taproot then they\ncould create their own counter-flag-day-activation which requires that a\ntransaction is included that does an invalid-spend from a taproot output\nin the first block after the flag day height.\n\nThis is always possible with any user activated soft fork. In BIP8\nLOT=true it could be done by rejecting block headers with certain\nversion bits signalled.\n\n\n== But it will take so long! ==\n\nWe seem to be at a deadlock now. This will take less time than any other\nmethod, because other methods might never happen. BIP8 is dead and from\nwhat I see there's no other credible plan.\n\nWe've already waited years for taproot. I remember listening to talks\nabout bitcoin from 2015 of people discussing Schnorr signatures. And\ngiven how slow segwit and p2sh adoption were its pretty likely that\nwe'll waiting a while for taproot to be actually adopted.\n\n\n== A social media blitz could still try to activate it early ==\n\nThe brinksmanship only works because miner signalling can make many\nother nodes activate early, even if those other nodes didn't do\nanything. There can't be a game of chicken that puts the bitcoin network\nat risk.\n\nIf a group of people did adopt alternative node software which has a\nshorter flag day, they actually have a risk of slow blocks. Because they\ncant trick or force any other nodes to come along with them, they are\nlikely to only have a small economy and therefore would lose a lot of\nhashrate. Imagine trading bitcoins for cash in person and instead of\nwaiting 10 minutes for a confirmation you have to wait 3 hours because\nthe blocks are slow.\n\nAlso, the argument for downloading and running a different software only\nto speed up activation is pretty weak. Taproot would activate in ~18\nmonths, so why are you so impatient that you need it in 6 months? And\nrisk slow blocks for you while doing so? The big difference with BIP148\nthe segwit UASF, is that people *had to* run some other software\notherwise they would get *no soft fork at all*.\n\n\n== Without miner signalling how do we know the new rules are even\nactivated? ==\n\nWhen did you see miners signalling their support for the inflation schedule?\n\nBitcoin's rules are enforced by wallets backed by full nodes. You'll\nalways know if your own full node is enforcing the new rules. The thing\nthat matters isnt miner signalling but your own full node, and the nodes\nof those you trade with.\n\nFlag day activation is quite similar to the way block reward halvenings\nwork. At and after block height 630000 miners are only allowed to create\n6.25 BTC rather than 12.5 BTC. Everyone knows that if miners continued\nto create 12.5 BTC or more they would be unable to sell or spend those\ncoins anywhere.\n\nIn 2017 when segwit was being activated people created a huge list of\nvarious bitcoin companies, merchants and wallets:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20171228111943/https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/\nLooking at that list, you would know that if someone stole coins from a\nsegwit address they would be unable to deposit them in many exchanges\nand merchants: Bitrefill, Bitstamp, Kraken, Localbitcoins, Paxful,\nVaultoro, HitBTC, etc.\n\nThen what happened is only a month after S2X was beaten this guy moved\n40000 BTC to a segwit address, confident about the power of the network\nto protect his coins.\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7tcmi4/bitcointalks_famous_user_loaded_moved_his_40k_btc/\n\nIf there's ever any doubt about flag day activation we can always draw\nup a similar list, although if there's broad consensus about it then\nthere's no reason why bitcoin businesses wouldn't upgrade to the latest\nCore, like they did with every other previous soft fork.\n\n\n== This gives the impression that Core developers control the protocol ==\n\nThis objection has a mirror image argument: BIP8 with LOT=false gives\nthe impression that miners control the protocol(!)\n\nEventually some group has to make a decision. We will ask the bitcoin\neconomy and users what they think of flag day activation. It's pretty\nclear that nobody seriously objects to taproot, and as described above\nif Core developers did something evil the community could resist it with\na counter-flag-day-activation.\n\n\n\n== TL;DR ==\n\nI believe flag day activation is the way forward.

Whether\ntaproot is dangerous is not the issue; whether old nodes should or should\nnot ignore new rules, is.\n\nFlag day activation of a soft fork is basically proposing a hard fork, but\nwithout saying or doing it at full commitment. May as well just do a flag\nday hard fork.\n\nBitcoin Cash/Bcash has already tested for you how a market driven hard fork\nshould work. Bitcoin didn't die. We should be learning from the mistakes\nmade in those early hard forks to not repeat them when Bitcoin hard forks -\nlike having replay protection written before deployment.\n\nIf it's not evident within the first 6-12 blocks which fork is winning,\nthen the market will trade it out. Just like what happened with Bitcoin\nCash/Bcash.\n\nNot only that, it stops the drama of Bitcoin Core devs from \"being in\ncontrol\" of consensus. The market will choose, you just create the safest\nway for users to participate. The market is consensus. Rough consensus is\njust the conversation starter.\n\n\nOn Thu, 4 Mar 2021, 1:39 am Chris Belcher via bitcoin-dev, <\nbitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n\n> The bitcoin world is close to total gridlock on the question of how to\n> activate taproot.

That seems like a big \n\"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that\" moment.

This is going to work because \nbasically nobody opposes Taproot. But if you did have some people \nopposing Taproot, it would still work, because nobody would want to \ndisobey Core.\n\n> Your argument depends heavily on the word \"egregious\". I've shown that\n> for harmful changes like censorship can be resisted by the bitcoin\n> community. Can you come up with an example of a bad change which won't\n> be resisted?\n\nExample 1: There is currently a specific mining pool planning to \nblacklist addresses on sanctions lists. If they were to \nconvince/bribe/threaten Core to soft-fork so as to burn one specific \nUTXO worth $1, the only direct victim of that would be the holder of \nthat UTXO, who loses only $1 from it.\n\nExample 2: A soft fork to decrease the block size by 0.1%.\n\nIf we assume that the current block size is optimal and censorship is \nbad, it seems simultaneously true that\n1) it would be bad to decrease the block size or to burn that UTXO\n2) nobody would be wiling to fight a war over a 0.1% decrease or a $1 \nloss to one guy\n\nYou might say that these are minor changes. Sure. But that's what I'm \nsaying: if the change is big (\"egregious\") enough to seriously \ninconvenience people, they would fight it, but if it's trivial (thought \nstill bad), the inertia of Core would force them to accept it.\n\n> Here's another example of an easily-resisted change: A Core team that's\n> been compromised might do a flag-day UASF where transactions are only\n> confirmed if they pay a minimum of 1000 sat/vbyte in miner fee.

But what if it's just 2sat/vbyte?\n\n>> At least you shouldn't hard-code it and require dissenters to fork \n>> away.\n>> I exhort you to consider making all this controversial stuff settings\n>> that can be changed by RPC command or command-line flag; set the \n>> default\n>> value sure, but requiring a fork to change it is, in my opinion,\n>> oppressive.\n> What alternative do you suggest?

The ability to do a counter-UASF should also be added, \nif it's envisioned somebody might want to do that.\n\nBasically, I think that Core should provide users with the tools to \nexpress their views and to exercise their economic power, and they could \ngive them default values according to what they think best.\n\nHowever, they shouldn't force people to use a forked client if they want \nto disobey them. That would be to abuse the power vested in the \ndevelopment group.\n\n>> On 2021-03-03 14:39, Chris Belcher via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n>>> Enter flag day activation.

Anyone can join and run whatever consensus\nrules they want.  People have run divergent consensus rules on the network\nin the past and it will continue to do so in the future.\nIt is troublesome when it happens in mass, but it isn't fatal.  We can't\nprevent it, and we should continue working to keep the protocol robust in\nthe face of it.\nAnd we certainly shouldn't be bullied by anyone who comes threatening their\nown soft-fork.\n\nEven simply doing nothing may not prevent divergent consensus from\nappearing on the network.  Playing conservative isn't playing it safe\nbecause there is nothing more conservative than doing nothing, which isn't\nguaranteed to be safe in this sense.\n\nSecondly, for the specific concern of people running BIP8 LOT=true clients,\nwe could start with \"Let\u2019s see what happens\" with a short 3 or 4 month\nsignaling period.  A short enough signaling period is not \"hijackable\".  We\ncould add a longer LOCKED_IN period if there are worries about getting\nenough nodes upgraded in time for activation.  I see other options as well.\n\nI keep being told that miners are ready and willing to activate, and\ntaproot will probably activate in two months.

However, as I pointed out on a Reddit discussion with \nAaron, I'm still incredibly worried about users pushing for some UASF-style forced-signaling guerilla faster-activation. \nIt may absolutely be the case that Taproot activates quickly or that such users are a tiny minority of transacting. \nHowever, as we saw with BIP 148/UASF, even a tiny minority of transacting users can set the tone and claim victory over \nhow a soft-fork activates. I worry that even your approach here runs the risk of yet further normalization of consensus \nrule diversity on the network.\n\nMaybe my worry is overblown, and I'm certainly not going to try to solely stand in the way on this one, but now that \nwe're stuck in yet another overblown debate, we might as well take it as an opportunity to reinforce the idea that \nconsensus rule diversity runs the risk of consensus failure, and isn't a reasonable risk.\n> \n>      > Even today, I still think that starting with BIP8 LOT=false is, generally speaking, considered a reasonably safe\n>      > activation method in the sense that I think it will be widely considered as a \"not wholly unacceptable\" approach to\n>      > activation.\n> \n>     How do you propose avoiding divergent consensus rules on the network, something which a number of commentors on this\n>     list have publicly committed to?\n> \n> \n> Firstly, it is an open network.\u00a0 Anyone can join and run whatever consensus rules they want.\u00a0 People have run divergent \n> consensus rules on the network in the past and it will continue to do so in the future.\n> It is troublesome when it happens in mass, but it isn't fatal.\u00a0 We can't prevent it, and we should continue working to \n> keep the protocol robust in the face of it.\n> And we certainly shouldn't be bullied by anyone who comes threatening their own soft-fork.\n\nApologies. I should have phrased my comment better. My worry, at a broad level is that\n(a) people have taken the events around the Segwit BIP 148 UASF to mean that a very small minority of users can (and \nmaybe should) push consensus rules through threats of breaking consensus and\n(b) there is a very vocal group today which is reinforcing this belief by ignoring the complex context around Segwit and \nbehaving similarly with regards to Taproot.\n\nIndeed, there is nothing we can, or should, do to actively prevent people from running their own software which \ninterprets Bitcoin's consensus rules in...creative ways. But that isn't to say there is no use worrying about it. 95% of \nBitcoin users aren't aware that this debate is even happening. Of the remaining 5%, 90% haven't had the time to research \nand think deeply enough to form an opinion.

It doesn't seem\nas focussed on safety as I'd expect from bitcoin.\n\n> After a normal and successful Core update with LOT=false, we will have more\n> data showing broad community support for the taproot upgrade in hand.\u00a0 In the\n> next release, 6 months later or so, Core could then confidently deploy a BIP8\n> LOT=true client, should it prove to be necessary.\n\nBIP8/lot=true is great for the situation we found ourselves in with\nBIP91/BIP148: there's an activation underway, that is being unexpectedly\nopposed, we want to ensure it activates, *and* we don't want to have\neveryone have to do a new round of software upgrades.\n\nBut if we're able to calmly put out a new release with new activation\nparameters, with enough time before it takes effect that everyone can\nreasonably upgrade to it, that's a pretty different situation.\n\nFirst, since we're giving everyone time to upgrade, it can be a clean\nsecondary deployment -- there's no need to try to drag the original\nlot=false users along -- we're giving everyone time to upgrade, and\neveryone includes them.\n\nSecond, lot=true implies we're doing some unsignalled consensus change\nanyway -- blocks would be considered invalid if they don't signal for\nactivation as of some height, with no prior on-chain signalling that\nthat rule change has occurred. So if we're allowing that, there's no\nprinciple that requires signalling to lock in the change we're actually\ntrying to activate.\n\nSo at that point why not simply reverse the burden of proof entirely? Run\nan initial \"speedy trial\" type event that allows fast activation via miner\nenforcement prior to everyone having upgraded; and if that fails but there\nhaven't been valid reasonable objections to activation identified, run\na secondary activation attempt that instead of requiring 90% signalling\nto activate, requires 90% signalling to *fail*.\n\nMiners not upgrading is then not a blocker, and even if a few miners are\nbuggy and signal accidently, that doesn't cause a risk to them of having\ntheir blocks dropped, or to the network of having the upgrade blocked.\n\nIf there are good reasons to object to the fork being activated that are\ndiscovered/revealed (very) late, this also provides an opportunity to\ncleanly cancel the activation by convincing miners that the activation\nis undesirable and having them agree to signal for cancellation (via\nBIP-91 style coordination or even BIP-148 style mandatory signalling, eg).\n\nAnd, on the other hand, if 90% of miners are opposed to a soft fork for\nsome selfish or bad reason, with that much hashpower they could easily do\na 51% attack on the network after activation to prevent any new features\nbeing used, so cancelling activation in that case is probably not worse\nin practice than it would be continue with it despite the opposition.\n\nI think a state machine along the lines of:\n\n  DEFINED - for 6 months after code release\n  STARTED - exactly 1 period\n    FAILED - if sufficient signalling occurs\n  DELAYED - 6 months\n  LOCKED_IN - exactly 1 period\n  ACTIVE\n\nwould work fine for an if-at-first-you-don't-succeed approach to\ndeployment along the above lines.\n\nThat seems to me to have a lot of desirable properties:\n\n - a minority of hashpower can't block activation\n\n - miners don't have to do anything and don't have to worry about\n   their blocks getting orphaned\n   \n - devs aren't making any final decisions on consensus changes,\n   even if everyone's committed to running the same codebase\n   (unlike when merging either lot=true or flag day activations)\n\n - there's no need to run different clients, or carefully configure your\n   node to stay in consensus\n\n - if economic actors want to influence activation by setting up\n   markets, they have a single signalling period to focus on, with 6\n   months lead time to set everything up and stabilise price discovery,\n   and a fairly definite endpoint and clear result for closing out\n   everyone's positions, whichever outcome occurs\n\n - there's no need/encouragement to use the machine vetting your business\n   income as leverage to force/prevent changes to bitcoin consensus;\n   configuring your node to not follow the most work chain is only\n   needed when both devs and miners are getting it wrong, *and* market\n   incentives haven't been enough to correct things\n\nThe main drawback is that it doesn't allow faster activation with miner\nsupport; even with a speedy trial first, it's just a boolean: did miners\nindicate they've upgraded quickly enough to hit the early activation\nor not?\n\nCheers,\naj"

Ideally such signaling could be placed in the witness nonce, however this may require pool updates to \nensure pool server software is not assuming the 32-byte-0-nonce in wide use today.

Because hashpower disagrees,\nthere's always a risk of a chain split in that case, so the additional\nrisk introduced by a signalling requirement is pretty minimal. That the\nlockinontimeout value is a setting means it can be switched only when\nwe're sure there aren't good reasons for the objection.\n\nThere is a lot of work to be done to make bitcoind have an acceptable\nchance of gracefully *surviving* a network split introduced by this sort\nof conflict; but provided no one started setting lockinontimeout=true\nuntil we were six or so months into an activation attempt (and hence\nhad the opportunity to judge whether the reasons for not activating\nwere bad), that would likely be enough time to start implementing some\nsafety mechanisms.\n\nBut there seems to be much more signficant support for the case 2 than I\nexpected; as evidenced by the \"let's do lockinontimeout=true immediately\"\nadvocacy, eg:\n\n  I am not willing to go to war for Taproot. I'll be honest the reason\n  I'm interested at all is that devs I respect spent a lot of energy and\n  time on it and I was reluctant to let their marginally beneficial work\n  go to waste.\n\n  I am, however, willing to go to war against LOT=False.\n\n   -- https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1363876292169465856\n\nI don't think bip8 is well-designed for that approach: most importantly,\nwith early adoption of lockinontimeout=true, bip8 *encourages* a consensus\nsplit in the event that good reasons for not activating are discovered\nafterwards, because lockinontimeout=false nodes remain able to abandon\nthe activation attempt. Consensus splits are terrible; they should be\na last resort used only in the event that bitcoin's fundamental nature\nis threatened, not a standard risk if bugs happened to be discovered\nlate. But additionally, if we are worried miners might not be acting\nin the interests of all bitcoin users, there are other games they could\nplay, such as \"if you want X activated quickly, also give us Y; otherwise\nwe'll delay it as long as possible\".\n\nLosing the opportunity to abandon an activation attempt, by whatever\nmechanism, also puts a lot more pressure on being absolutely sure of the\ndesirability of the change at the point when it's merged; because miners,\nthird-party devs, businesses, and users don't even have the option of\nattempting to influence miners, all objections needs to be raised when\nthe activation parameters are merged, which raises the stakes for that\nevent substantially.\n\nI think my conclusions from that are:\n\n * as it stands, people are expecting to run bip8/lot=true nodes on the\n   network immediately; so deploying bip8/lot=false with compatible\n   parameters risks causing consensus splits, and should not be done\n\n * David Harding's \"speedy trial\" approach probably doesn't suffer from\n   the problems -- running a lot=true variant would require enforcing\n   signalling prior to the end of July, which is an unreasonable timeframe\n   to expect the majority of economic nodes to upgrade in; if bip9 is\n   used, then the risk of enforcement occuring with minority hashrate\n   (and thus having fewer retarget periods before the timeout is\n   reached) would also make a bip148/lot=true variant difficulty\n\n * if people want a \"taproot is guaranteed to activate no later than X\"\n   PR merged, someone needs to do a *lot* more outreach to be sure that\n   that's the right outcome, and it's not just devs/maintainers making\n   the call\n\n * IMO, Matt's proposed approach is both a better and simpler approach\n   to avoid giving miners undue influence on consensus; as such I've\n   drafted up a sample implementation:\n\n     https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21378\n\n   (Backporting it to 0.21 just requires backporting #19438, which is\n   straightforward)\n\nSo I think that means my preference is to do the \"speedy trial\" with\nsignalling first, and if that fails, then either we've established there\nare real problems with taproot and will go back to the drawing board to\nfix them, or if we have not found problems by that time we should simply\nswitch to a straight flag day activation as Matt proposes. Presumably\nwe'll have established broard community consensus for activation if no\nobjections are discovered during the speedy trial.\n\nCheers,\naj"

                "message_text_only": "One should not assume that those trying to avoid a chain split are against Taproot.\n\n \n\nThere is a concerning widespread misperception in the community at large that soft forks are inherently \u201cbackward compatible\u201d. To many people this seems to mean that, even without hash power enforcement, activation will not create a chain split. This is no doubt reinforced by loose wording in past proposals, such as the unqualified, \u201cAs a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without modification.\u201d (BIP141). If operating means not crashing, then hard forks also qualify. Many people do not understand that hash power enforcement is also required for a soft fork to avoid a chain split.\n\n \n\nThis misperception has also been fed by devs who should know better claiming that BIP16 was not signaled by supermajority hash power before it was activated. The only distinction being that an *automated* activation method had not yet been developed. Starting with BIP16 *all active soft forks* have been activated by supermajority hash power signaling. I was told publicly by someone who should certainly know better that SegWit missed its BIP9 activation window and that BIP9 failed. Yet SegWit activated under BIP9 2.5 months before its activation window closed. It never entered its FAILED state and remains in its ACTIVE state (BIP90 being presumed to be merely a code optimization). This type of misinformation is a root cause of much of the conflict.\n\n \n\nYes, some people threatened to split themselves off with BIP148, and yes miners used BIP91 to accelerate SegWit enforcement, preventing that split well before the SegWit the activation window was set to expire. So those people claim BIP9 failed. It\u2019s a false narrative. BIP9 could have failed, but did not. Soft fork activation could be unsupported by miners, but to date no such activation attempt has failed. No doubt it will someday. But why are people picking a fight where there isn\u2019t one.\n\n \n\nThis should not about who gets to \u201cdecide the rules\u201d, but that is exactly what it has become. It\u2019s the only explanation for the conflict. Otherwise there does not appear to be any whatsoever. Miner activation is used if at all possible because it avoids a chain split. It\u2019s as simple as that. Anyone can of course decide what rules they run. But telling them that they can do so without splitting is flatly irresponsible. If it comes to that, inform people properly and let them decide.\n\n \n\nThe reason for BIP8 is clearly to codify activation without hash power support. You are right that BIP8(LOT=false) is just BIP9. The other differences are immaterial. Given that there are other differences, it seems advisable to use what has already been coded, tested, deployed, and successful in the past. It\u2019s also understandable that many devs no not want to be responsible for shipping code to large numbers of people who are misinformed about its behavior, potentially causing a chain split and loss of both money and faith in the system.\n\n \n\nIf one needs to consider this a question of who gets to decide, it\u2019s not clear to me why one would side with exchanges over miners given that the latter are able to prevent a chain split. HODLer nodes are non-economic, to the extent they even exist. This isn\u2019t a David vs. Goliath scenario, and even if it was, the supposed giant appears to overwhelmingly support Taproot.\n\n \n\ne\n\n \n\nFrom: bitcoin-dev <bitcoin-dev-bounces at lists.linuxfoundation.org> On Behalf Of Jorge Tim\u00f3n via bitcoin-dev\nSent: Monday, March 8, 2021 4:52 AM\nTo: Anthony Towns <aj at erisian.com.au>; Bitcoin Protocol Discussion <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>\nSubject: Re: [bitcoin-dev] Straight Flag Day (Height) Taproot Activation\n\n \n\nConcept nack.\n\nThis has no advantage over bip8(true).\n\nBip9(false) is just bip9.\n\nThr only reasonable argument against bip8(true) is \"some people may do bip8(false) instead\", which is a stypid argument applyable to any activation method.\n\n \n\nPeople against taproot should want code to forbid its activation rather than limiting themselves to suport bip9/bip8(false) and hope it doesn't get activated it.\n\n \n\nSome other arguments seem to be based on the wrong assumption that miners should decide the rules.\n\n \n\nThisproposal solves nothing, just adds to the noise and thus is really disappointing.\n\n \n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210308/8f977f39/attachment-0001.html>"

(By later deploying a\nrevised activation mechanism with LOT=true or other.)\n\nArguments against have included a major concern about perpetuating the risk\ndemonstrated by the BIP 141 / BIP 9 with potential for misuse and\nmisunderstanding of a normative mechanism as a political veto.  Such veto\ncan be overridden by the market, but the forced need to do so increases\ndrama and risk.\n\nArguments in favor include being defensive to avoid misinterpretation about\ndeveloper control, and being considered and incremental in starting with a\nsafe conservative approach\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lcjhl6/taproot_activation_pools_will_be_able_to_veto/gm2l02w/\n\n\nThough it should be acknowledged and taken into account that disagreement\nand potential for partly incompatible clients with different activation\nconfiguration, changes the risk calculation for LOT=false.  So that\nLOT=false may not be safer in practice, and does not wash reference client\ndevelopers hands of contributing to the combined risk.\n\n2) MASF=true + LOT=true\n\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018545.html\n\nArguments in favor, inverse of above.  But if LOT=true is a hidden flag in\nbitcoin reference code, or released by another project, then\nmisinterpretation of developer control is avoided.\n\nWould there be consensus for the reference implementation doing nothing,\nand signal intent to follow the market if a non-contentious LOT=true gains\ntraction?  With explicit communication of this intent and reason for\ninitial non-inclusion.\n\nThere were also concerns about offending miners.  This concern seems\ndubious to many, given pools indicated ~90% support\nhttps://taprootactivation.com/ and are less detail oriented.  But also BIP\n148/ BIP 91 sequence events was enormously dangerous and worth minor social\ncohesion to avoid as a category of risk.\n\nAgainst the realism of developer control, if there were a market need to\nreject a soft-fork, that can also be done with a UASF.  But UASF is\ndramatic and the signaling direction against should be reserved for the low\nprobability outcome.\n\n3) MASF=false + LOT=informational\n\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018495.html\n\nNo miner activation.  This is interesting in using the non-standardness\npart of schnorr to activate at a flag height without normative signaling in\nversion bits.  But the combined removal in this proposal of (normative\nsignaled) MASF is problematic for the needless delay it creates.\n\nIt seems probable that the delay itself would motivate users to switch to\nclients with MASF+UASF (LOT=true) in protest.  It is true that schnorr\nrequires wallet work, but that overlooks the philosophical nature of the\nrejection of unneeded delay and empirical evidence shows rather\nconclusively that ecosystem players are predominantly selectively lazy and\nonly work on Bitcoin infrastructure upgrades after the fact.\n\nSubsequent posts on the thread with this proposal discuss that\ninformational signaling be substituted so that users and the market can\nbenefit from the information about miner intent.  As it is non-normative it\nseems hard to argue against: more information is better.\n\n4) MASF=true + LOT=informational\n\n>From the above it would be interesting to see discussion of a combination\nof MASF=true (same mechanism as 1 or 2) with LOT=informational (mechanism\nfrom 3).  Where, again, informational means signaling is provided but in an\noptional and informational sense, that is not normative for consensus code,\nbut to inform the ecosystem about a hashrate verified opt-in assertion of\nreadiness from pools.  In some way that could be more reliable in signaling\na willing readiness rather than a UASF under duress mandatory signal.\n\nConsider also with 2 or 4) alike (or 1 after switching to 2), in the event\nthat activation were unreasonably delayed, forced miner signaling from 2)\ncould be argued to be less reliable as the mechanism for signaling on pools\nhas no automated link to fullnode software version.  In the MASF delay\neventuality, where the flag height is relied upon, users and services would\nbe well advised to ensure they are running schnorr validating fullnodes,\nand for SPV users to verify their wallet relies on schnorr upgraded\nfullnodes.\n\nJohn R\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210304/0bf18cf7/attachment-0001.html>"

Obviously: no; but by what\nnon-arbitrary process do we decide?\n\nI propose that the BIP Editor's role should include preserving signal\nin the table of contents generated from our proposal repository, by\nunilaterally rejecting - without any fuhrer comment - technically well\nconstructed proposals which are guaranteed to be rejected based on\nprior discussions in the community, as spam.  I think this is already\nhow it works, but we haven't actually written down this part of the\nnorms.\n\nSince censorship is always a concern, it would be appropriate to\nmaintain a moderation log of spam BIPs, so that observers could judge\nwhether the BIP Editor is misusing the BIP assignment process to\ncensor proposals with some merit.  Since one of the requirements for\nsubmitting a BIP is to notify bitcoin-dev, the log is already\nmaintained.  Since bitcoin-dev is moderated, the moderators take on a\nlow level of responsibility for gauging spam proposals (and they are\npretty relaxed about it, since it is better to err on the side of\ninclusion for new developers, except for obvious patent bombing).\nSince the bitcoin-dev moderation log is public and anyone can\nsubscribe to it, protective transparency is again achieved.\n\n  https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev-moderation/"

                "message_text_only": "Actually I mentioned a proof of space and time hybrid which is much\ndifferent than staking. Sorry to draw for the confusion as PoC is more\ncommonly used then PoST.\nThere is a way to make PoC cryptographically compatible w/ Proof of Work as\nit normally stands: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_space\nIt has rarely been done though given the technological complexity of being\nboth CPU compatible and memory-hard compatible. There are lots of benefits\noutside of the realm of efficiency, and I already looked into numerous\nfault tolerant designs as well and what others in the cryptography\ncommunity attempted to propose. The actual argument you have only against\nthis is the Proof of Memory fallacy, which is only partially true. Given\nhow the current hashing algorithm works, hard memory allocation wouldn't be\nof much benefit given it is more optimized for CPU/ASIC specific mining.\nI'm working towards a hybrid mechanism that fixes that. BTW: The way\nBitcoin currently stands in its cryptography still needs updating\nregardless. If someone figures out NP hardness or the halting problem the\ntraditional rule of millions of years to break all of Bitcoin's\ncryptography now comes down to minutes. Bitcoin is going to have to\neventually radically upgrade their cryptography and hashing algo in the\nfuture regardless. I want to integrate some form of NP complexity in\nregards to the hybrid cryptography I'm aiming to provide which includes a\npolynomial time algorithm in the cryptography. More than likely the first\nversion of my BTC hard fork will be coded in a way where integrating such\ncomplexity in the future only requires a soft fork or minor upgrade to its\nchain.\n\nIn regards to the argument, \"As a separate issue, proposing a hard fork in\nthe hashing algorithm will invalidate the enormous amount of capital\nexpenditure by mining entities and disincentivize future capital\nexpenditure into mining hardware that may compute these more \"useful\"\nproofs of work.\"\n\nA large portion of BTC is already mined through AWS servers and non-asic\nspecific hardware anyways. A majority of them would benefit from a hybrid\nproof, and the fact that it is hybrid in that manner wouldn't\ndisenfranchise currently optimized mining entities as well.\n\nThere are other reasons why a cryptography upgrade like this is beneficial.\nTheoretically one can argue BItcoin isn't fully decentralized. It is few\nunsolved mathematical proofs away from being entirely broken. My goal\noutside of efficiency is to build cryptography in a way that prevents such\nan event from happening in the future, if it was to ever happen. I have\nvarious research in regards to this area and work alot with distributed\ncomputing.

If someone figures out NP hardness or the halting problem the traditional rule of millions of years to break all of Bitcoin's cryptography now comes down to minutes. Bitcoin is going to have to eventually radically upgrade their cryptography and hashing algo in the future regardless. I want to integrate some form of NP complexity in regards to the hybrid cryptography I'm aiming to provide which includes a polynomial time algorithm in the cryptography. More than likely the first version of my BTC hard fork will be coded in a way where integrating such complexity in the future only requires a soft fork or minor upgrade to its chain.\n>>>> >>>\n>>>> >>> In regards to the argument, \"As a separate issue, proposing a hard fork in the hashing algorithm will invalidate the enormous amount of capital expenditure by mining entities and disincentivize future capital expenditure into mining hardware that may compute these more \"useful\" proofs of work.\"\n>>>> >>>\n>>>> >>> A large portion of BTC is already mined through AWS servers and non-asic specific hardware anyways.

If the work was useful it provides an avenue for actors to have nothing at stake when submitting a proof of work, since the marginal cost of block construction will be lessened by the fact that the work was useful in a different context and therefore would have been done anyway.

Memory hard computation allows for time and space complexity for data storage functionality, and there is a way this can likely be implemented without disenfranchising current miners or their hardware if done right.\n\nI believe this represents a tradeoff between time and space --- either you use one spatial unit and take a lot of time, or you use multiple spatial units and take smaller units of time.\n\nBut such time/space tradeoffs are already possible with the existing mechanism --- if you cannot run your existing SHA256d miner faster (time), you just buy more miners (space).\n\nThus, I think the requirement for memory hardness is a red herring in the design of proof-of-work algorithms.\nMemory hardness *prevents* this tradeoff (you cannot create a smaller miner that takes longer to mine, as you have a memory requirement that prevents trading off space).\n\nIt is also helpful to remember that spinning rust consumes electricity as well, and that any operation that requires changes in data being stored requires a lot of energy.\nIndeed, in purely computational algorithms (e.g. CPU processing pipelines) a significant amount of energy is spent on *changing* voltage levels, with very little energy (negligible compared to the energy spent in changing voltage levels in modern CMOS hardware) in *maintaining* the voltage levels.\n\n> I don't see a reason why somebody with $2m of regular hardware can't mine the same amount of BTC as somebody with $2m worth of ASICs.\n\nI assume here that \"regular hardware\" means \"general-purpose computing device\".\n\nThe Futamura projections are a good reason I see: http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/05/three-projections-of-doctor-futamura.html\n\nBasically, any interpreter + fixed program can be converted, via Futamura projection, to an optimized program that cannot interpret any other program but runs faster and takes less resources.\n\nIn short, any hardware interpreter (i.e. general-purpose computing device) + a fixed proof-of-whatever program, can be converted to an optimized hardware that can only perform that proof-of-whatever program, but consuming less energy and space and will (eventually) be cheaper per unit as well, so that $2M of such a specific hardware will outperform $2M of general-purpose computing hardwre.\n\nThus, all application-specificity (i.e. any fixed program) will always take less resources to run than a generic hardware interpreter that can run any program.\n\nThus, if you ever nail down the specifics of your algorithm, and if a thousand-Bitcoin industry ever grows around that program, you will find that ASICs ***will*** arise that run that algorithm faster and less energy-consuming than general-purpose hardware that has to interpret a binary.\n**For one, memory/disk bus operations are limited only to actual data, without requiring additional bus operations to fetch code.**\nData can be connected directly from the output of one computational sub-unit to the input of another, without requiring (as in the general-purpose hardware case) that the intermediate outputs be placed in general-purpose storage register (which, as noted, takes energy to *change* its contents, and as general-purpose storage will also be used to hold *other* intermediate outputs).\nSpecialized HDDs can arise as well which are optimized for whatever access pattern your scheme requires, and that would also outperform general-purpose HDDs as well.\n\nFurther optimizations may also exist in an ASIC context that are not readily visible but which are likely to be hidden somewhere --- the more complicated your program design, the more likely it is that you will not readily see such hidden optimizations that can be achieved by ASICs (xref ASICBOOST).\n\nIn short, even with memory-hardness, an ASIC will arise which might need to be connected to an array of (possibly specialized) HDDs but which will still outperform your general-purpose hardware connected to an array of general-purpose storage.\n\nIndeed, various storage solutions already have different specializations: SMR HDDs replace tape drives, PMR HDDs serve as caches of SMR HDDs, SSDs serve as caches of PMR HDDs.\nAn optimized technology stack like that can outperform a generic HDD.\n\nYou cannot fight the inevitability of ASICs and other specialized hardware, just as you cannot fight specialization.\n\nYou puny humans must specialize in order to achieve the heights of your civilization --- I can bet you 547 satoshis that you yourself cannot farm your own food, you specialize in software engineering of some kind and just pay a farmer to harvest your food for you.\nIndeed, you probably do not pay a farmer directly, but pay an intermediary that specializes in packing food for transport from the farm to your domicile. which itself probably delegates the actual transporting to another specialist.\nSimilarly, ASICs will arise and focus on particularly high-value fixed computations, inevitably.\n\n\n\nRegards,\nZmnSCPxj"

It's hard to tell.\n\n\nI think Luke's proposal fixes a lot of concerns on both sides of the\nLOT discussion.\nI went through all the Taproot activation discussion I could find, as\nwell as some old segwit activation discussions, and here I summarize\npoints that will hopefully convince all supporters from all sides of\nthe Taproot activation discussion.\nSome points are repeated but framed differently based on the reader's\npredisposition (LOT=true or LOT=false or flag day).\nSomething to note is that this is not a compromise, I mention it at the bottom.\n\n\nThe case for this new proposal for supporters of LOT=true first:\n1. no veto bug) Miners wouldn't have veto power. If 51% of miners are\nsignaling during MUST_SIGNAL phase Taproot activates. This proposal\nfollows the will of the community. (point 5 on Matt's Modern Soft Fork\nActivation proposal\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html)\n2. signaling used for coordination instead of voting) The requirement\nfor a 95% supermajority vote disappears since those, what would have\npreviously been seen as, votes are irrelevant during the MUST_SIGNAL\nphase. The 51% threshold is also seen as a coordination mechanism for\nusers to gauge miner support to automatically split from an unupgraded\nminer minority.\n4. low threshold UASF) It's much much easier to do a UASF marketing\nblitz since only 51% of mining power needs to enforce the new rules\nand the supermajority is not required. Mining power (51% of it needed)\nwill probably be convinced if exchanges, wallet software, and a\nmoderate number of users are on the Taproot activation side\n(significant economic activity). This was a major problem in 2017\nbecause it was uncertain whether signaling miners were running BIP9 or\nUASF.\n5. no UASF minority chain) If LOT=true is released and it never\nachieves 50% signaling then there would be a fork and the UASF chain\nwill be exposed to attacks or destabilization due to miners switching\nbetween chains. This proposal avoids that situation because it\nguarantees that a majority of mining power is supporting Taproot so\nthe chain can't be attacked. You never really wanted to fork off from\nyour friends right?\n3. nodes stay in consensus) If Taproot does not achieve a\nsupermajority but does achieve a simple majority (>51% PoW) at the end\nof activation then upgraded users, upgraded miners, and non-upgraded\nwill all follow the taproot-active ruleset, leaving a minority of\nminers to be exposed to reorgs if they don't enforce the new Taproot\nrules. At this point the economic majority will very clearly be in the\ntaproot-activated chain so this creates strong pressure for the\nminority of miners to capitulate or hard/soft fork off. (I imagine\nthey will capitulate... unless they want to have fun being poor)\n6. no double spends) No need to stress about writing code to prevent\ndouble spends the chain will stay together.\n7. no PoW change) No need to stress about changing the PoW unless the\nminer majority doesn't signal. In that case a flag day is needed with\na PoW change so the forked chain is safe. It's too risky to have to\nre-upgrade, in the middle of Taproot deployment, to a new client to\ndeploy a PoW change in the event that the majority mining power is not\non board.\n7. minority miners forced to comply or fork off) Zealous miners\nagainst the proposed feature are forced to hard fork with an\nanti-Taproot fork if signaling is greater than 51%. The hard fork will\nhave 49% in the worst case, probably much less if we assume humans are\ngreedy. The miner minority may attack if they are confident they will\nsucceed. But their success is unlikely due Nakamoto consensus.\n8. no early adopter dilema) There is no reluctance of upgrading\nbecause it's more likely the new version will be on the chain with the\nmost PoW. This fixes the early adopter dilemma.\n9. no late adopter stress) Since the result of activation keeps all\nusers together and minority miners are forced off, late adopters don't\nneed to worry about upgrading their client to not risk being reorged.\nThey will be on the taproot activated chain.\n10. majority attracts the undecided) At 51% of mining power and an\neconomic majority I would say Greg Maxwell's \"opposed unless there is\nclear consensus on LOT=true\" is very well satisfied. (paraphrase\nprovided by michaelfolkson\nhttp://gnusha.org/taproot-activation/2021-02-16.log)\n11. discovered bugs can back out deployment) With forced activation\nthere is no way to back out activation unless all users revert to\nusing a previous version or upgrade to using a new fixed version. But\nit's not guaranteed that all users will revert or upgrade. This\nproposal allows a cancelation if we force the majority of miners to\nnot signal.\n12. no alt-nodes) A UASF media blitz can achieve activation with 51%\nminer support and can be executed with a client released by core\ninstead of an alt-node.\n13. no dev+miner forced changes) Users maintain sovereignty in future\nsoft forks by maintaining the option of creating anti-feature hard\nfork or soft fork movements as long as they have enough mining power\nto maintain a safe chain. Miners and devs don't have ultimate power.\n(unless a supermajority of both groups agree to an anti-user feature\nbut I find that unthinkable right now since the economic majority\nwouldn't comply easily, may happen in the future, who knows)\n14. no dev forced changes) Avoid a power grab from core developers and\na minority of users. They can't force a feature change because miners\nand an economic majority together can veto. At minimum the forced\nfeature requires 51% mining power and zero user support, even in that\ncase majority users still have options. (point 10)\n15. less miner polling pre-deployment) One of the rationales to lower\nthe activation threshold from 95% to 90% is due to 89% verbal miner\nsupport https://taprootactivation.com/ . I saw some people wanted to\ngo as low as 85% or 80%, hell someone on the ##uasf channel wanted to\ndrop threshold to 65% to incentivize non-upgraded nodes to join the\nUASF alt-node http://gnusha.org/uasf/2021-03-04.log . With this\nproposal it doesn't matter if miners don't overwhelmingly support the\nfeature so their verbal input is less significant. Deployment can\nhappen as soon as 51% of mining power express verbal support, unlike\nwhat's happening right now where miner apathy is delaying deployment\nbecause no one is sure whether a supermajority is achievable.\n16. new status quo) I'm not sure I understand when Luke says LOT=true\nis status quo but this proposal probably fixes that too? This proposal\nkind of acts like a flag day with the protection of a majority PoW.\n\n\nThe case for this new proposal for supporters of LOT=false first:\n1. discovered bugs can back out deployment) The activation can be\ncanceled and the chain will remain united if any problem is found.\n(point 1 on Matt's Modern Soft Fork Activation proposal\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html)\n2. miner minority can't cancel) Only 51% of mining power can cancel if\na bug is found so a minority of miners can't abuse the threat of\ncanceling for political reasons.\n3. no need for miner promises) In the back of the minds of LOT=false\nsupporters there is always the doubt of \"what if we really can't trust\nminers?\". We can ask them and make them promise that they will support\nthe upgrade but we can never really know. With this proposal we don't\nneed to worry about a miner minority promising to signal and then\nbreaking the promise.\n4. no UASF aggression at the start) Miners aren't antagonized because\nthey are still part of the signaling process and they keep their right\nto run any client they want without the threat of a UASF. Though they\nwill eventually mine orphan blocks if they don't upgrade, which is\nprobably true for a handful of miners even today.\n5. UASF is optional) If miners seem to be stalling or not signaling\nusers have the option of running a media blitz without having to\ncoordinate the release of a new UASF client. This removes the\ncomplications of multiple client releases interacting to activate the\nsame feature.\n6. UASF is reactive) Forcing miners to upgrade with a media blitz and\na threat to create a hard fork later will be after miners are shown to\nbe apathetic or malicious. Users have time to gather information while\nthe MUST_SIGNAL period approaches.\n7. no user forced changes) Removes the precedent of users forcing\nchanges on miners because they must attain 51% miner support. If users\nhave less than 51% miner support they must hard fork instead.\n8. safe supermajority activation) The threshold will remain in\nsupermajority territory 95% before the MUST_SIGNAL phase. When a\nsupermajority is achieved there will be minimal disruption and minimal\ndetriment to Bitcoin's security. (point 3 on Matt's Modern Soft Fork\nActivation proposal\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html)\n9. users have time to upgrade) Users will have an appropriate amount\nof time to upgrade. (whatever time it takes to achieve supermajority)\n(point 2 on Matt's Modern Soft Fork Activation proposal\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html)\n10. no long deployments) In case of miners not reaching a\nsupermajority due to apathy we won't have to wait six months and then\nanother release and another long deployment.\n11. no UASF minority chain) Users won't be reorged because if at the\nend of activation support is below 51% taproot wont activate and users\nwill stay together.\n12. no big reorgs) If more than 51% of miners support Taproot then\nupgraded users, non-upgraded users, and minority miners will stay on\nthe same chain. Some non-upgraded users and miners will be at risk of\ncreating and following orphan blocks. But the likelihood is that the\nminer minority will upgrade if we assume that they are self-interested\nand don't want to mine orphan blocks. This results in a small risk of\nchain split and small risk of big reorgs. (point 4 on Matt's Modern\nSoft Fork Activation proposal\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html)\n13. no late adopter stress) If mining power majority is not achieved\nduring activation then all miners stay on the same chain and late\nadopters don't need to worry about the risk of some UASF chain\novertaking theirs.\n14. no divergent consensus rules) The chain can stay together and our\nfriends won't fork off because we will all be running the same client\nand the client will be backwards compatible.\n15. no need for redeployment) If activation fails it's clear that it\nhappened due to a lack of a majority of clients supporting the change\nand a lack of a strong enough economic group to force miners to\nupgrade. So if activation fails we can be sure that we won't be\nreleasing the feature again or the feature must be released as a hard\nfork if a group of users really really want it.\n16. no co-optable deployment) No more LOT flag so code can't be easily\nmodified to create divergent consensus from a core release.\n17. no incentive to force signaling) A big reason for users to force\nsignaling is for reorg protection in case they are in a minority\nchain. With this proposal the UASF chain is protected from reorgs by a\nminer majority so no need to force signaling.\n18. no configurable consensus) No more LOT flag so no need for a\nparameter/config value to force users to pick a side on upgrade.\nForcing the choice on users guarantees there will be users running a\nUASF but at the same time reduces the likelihood of a successful UASF\ndue to other users running LOT=false.\n19. no alt-nodes) If this proposal gains consensus and it can be\nreleased in core then we will avoid the issue of fracturing groups of\ncore forks jockeying for user support.\n20. miners can test features before deployment) If changes can be\nwritten to core without contention or risk of divergent consensus.\nCore can release RCs for miners and users to test the feature. I think\nit would have helped to know the segwit-ASIC boost conflict before\nsegwit signaling even though there is no guarantee that it would have\nbeen disclosed. But maybe having this ability will be useful for other\nfeatures.\n21. no false flagging interference) No need for two activation periods\nso no need to worry about buggy miner signaling software (false\nflagging) that may continue to signal for the prior deployment. This\nis a potential issue for modern soft fork activation. (this issue is\nmentioned by AJ Towns in the decreasing threshold proposal\nhttps://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/202007-activation-dec-thresh/bip-decthresh.mediawiki)\n22. no dev vilification) Core developers can't be portrayed as having\nultimate power because they at least require 51% miner support.\n23. safe supermajority threshold) Since the threshold will drop to 51%\nduring MUST_SIGNAL we could take the luxury of raising the\nsupermajority threshold back to 95% instead of 90%. This increases the\nrisk of miner stalling but that's the worst that could happen, which\nis pretty good IMO.\n24. no flag day) Avoids the pressure of devs pulling the trigger on a\nflag day because this proposal removes (reduces?) the likelihood that\nthere will be a future chain split. This takes a lot of pressure off\nof devs releasing this deployment.\n25. no Taproot death) If we go with LOT=false first and it fails,\nthere is no getting around the fact that one group will want LOT=true\nand the other group will want to drop Taproot altogether. I think devs\nwill still have a hard time deploying LOT=true after LOT=false.\n26. no procrastinating) Since the deployment period doesn't need to be\ntoo long for a safe LOT=true (after a failed LOT=false signaling\nperiod) then there isn't a risk of users and miners procrastinating\nupgrades until the last 3 or so months before the flag day.\n27. another activation failure does not kill the MASF method) If\nLOT=false fails again it was likely we would have never used it again.\nThat would be the death of quick MASF. But with this proposal the only\nway to fail is if a majority of miners are against the feature and\nhave been unconvinced by an economic minority media blitz. In which\ncase the feature is contentious but the activation method remains\nintact.\n\n\nThe case for this proposal for supporters of a straight flag-day:\n1. no divergent consensus rules) all nodes will be compatible and\nbackwards compatible so they will all stay with the same consensus\nrules.\n2. discovered bugs can back out deployment) A flag day can't be\ncanceled. With this proposal if we find a bug it's easy for miners to\nrevert to an old version to get signaling below 51%.\n3. signaling is available) With signaling we can all see the progress\nof the activation. We will know if it's near a supermajority, we will\nknow if it's near the 51% milestone. Without signaling we might fail\nto gather adoption and not even know which miners were actually\nrunning the new version.\n4. majority hash power will stay together) All users and the majority\nmining power will stay on the same chain. It's possible that a\nminority of mining power will fall out of consensus if they don't\nenforce Taproot rules but if we assume they will act in their best\ninterest then they will upgrade once the simple majority of mining\npower is signaling. Minority miners that are staunchly against\nupgrading or are just really really really lazy and maybe take mining\nas a hobby will fork off. But It's not possible to force those\nminority miners anyway. For example there could be a minority of\nminers running pre-segwit software today.\n5. no redeploy to move the date) With a 95% threshold and a 51% at the\nend we can be certain that the change will or won't activate. So no\nneed to scramble to move dates or potentially release a LOT=false\nclient earler than the flag day. Any of that scrambing is gone because\nwe just wait. The worst that could happen is a 6% miner minority can\ndelay the change until the MUST_SIGNAL period.\n6. it's clear who wins under contention) Flag day activations need as\nmuch economic adoption as any other method. With a flag day, any\ncontention in the feature will lead to entrenched groups and a split\nis inevitable. With this proposal the economic majority decides by\nforcing miners to signal one way or another by threatening a hard\nfork. But with this proposal it's clear that who wins the debate is\nwho wins 51% miner support so the economic majority (if it's very\nsmall will likely reconsider not forking off). With a flag day, who\nwins the debate is only clear years after the flag day based on market\ncapitalization.\n7. can start building early) Developers will have high assurance that\nthe change will activate after the 51% threshold is reached so they\ncan start building after 51% and don't need to wait until the\nsupermajority.\n8. MASF is available) Activation can happen very early with a\nsupermajority since Taproot is not contentious. (still the most likely\noutcome, by far!)\n9. no dev forced changes) Avoid a power grab from core developers to\nrush a flag day that doesn't have enough economic majority. Once the\nclient is released the chain split is nearly guaranteed. With this\nproposal devs would need a miner majority and a supporting economic\nmajority or an apathetic economy supermajority.\n\n\nThe case for this new proposal for supporters of gradual decreasing\nactivation threshold:\n1. no gaming thresholds) Miners can't suddenly signal at 55% threshold\nto force 45% of non-signaling miners to scramble an update.\n\n\nThe case for this new proposal for supporters on all sides:\n1. conservative enough for core) If we can fix all the kinks and\nachieve some consensus I think this proposal will be safe enough to be\nsupported by core devs.\n2. remove activation contention) If things go well we might get a few\nmore rounds of soft fork activation without contention.\n3. no ambiguity on which chain is bitcoin) If there is a minority\ngroup that forks off then the chain called Bitcoin will be the one\nwith the most economic support and miner support. With this come the\nbenefits that 21 million stays 21 million and $1 trillion stays $1\ntrillion. Unless a majority of mining power is trying to force a soft\nfork that antagonizes the economic majority. Tthis miner oppression\nwould then be considered a 51% attack and maybe a PoW change is in\norder.\n4. *this is a real solution not a compromise*) I think this solution\nfixes so many issues on both sides of the LOT debate that I see it as\nbetter than either solution independently. This is a real solution and\nthe added benefit is that it's a solution that coincidentally brings\nboth sides of the debate together.\n5. only contentious changes make contentious activation) Contentious\nactivations will be ones that have near 50/50 miner support. Features\nlike that will probably never even get to the activation stage and\nTaproot is not one of them.\n6. no LOT drama) The LOT flag is removed so no more default to argue\nover. No more drama. And no cover for social attacks on bitcoin.\n7. no mid-deployment changes) Deployment is on complete autopilot so\nusers don't need to change any configuration in the middle of\ndeployment period.\n\n\nLeave it to bitcoiners to turn bitcoin's biggest flaw (51% attacks)\ninto a feature (51% upgrade pressure). The Bitcoin space is so\nfascinating.\nI hope there isn't some giant obvious flaw I'm missing. Please tell me\nif I am. Or add to the arguments if you'd like.\n\n\nCheers\nAriel Lorenzo-Luaces"

                "message_text_only": "On the ##taproot-activation IRC channel, Russell O'Connor recently\nproposed a modification of the \"Let's see what happens\" activation\nproposal.[1] The idea received significant discussion and seemed\nacceptable to several people who could not previously agree on a\nproposal (although this doesn't necessarily make it their first\nchoice).  The following is my attempt at a description.\n\n1. Start soon: shortly after the release of software containing this\n   proposed activation logic, nodes will begin counting blocks towards\n   the 90% threshold required to lock in taproot.[2]\n\n2. Stop soon: if the lockin threshold isn't reached within approximately\n   three months, the activation attempt fails.  There is no mandatory\n   activation and everyone is encouraged to try again using different\n   activation parameters.\n   \n2. Delayed activation: in the happy occasion where the lockin threshold\n   is reached, taproot is guaranteed to eventually activate---but not\n   until approximately six months after signal tracking started.\n\n## Example timeline\n\n(All dates approximate; see the section below about BIP9 vs BIP8.)\n\n- T+0: release of one or more full nodes with activation code\n- T+14: signal tracking begins\n- T+28: earliest possible lock in\n- T+104: locked in by this date or need to try a different activation process\n- T+194: activation (if lockin occurred)\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe goal of Speedy Trial is to allow a taproot activation attempt to\neither quickly succeed or quickly fail---without compromising safety in\neither case.  Details below:\n\n### Mitigating the problems of early success\n\nNew rules added in a soft fork need to be enforced by a large part of\nthe economy or there's a risk that a long chain of blocks breaking the\nrules will be accepted by some users and rejected by others, causing a\nchain split that can result in large direct losses to transaction\nreceivers and potentially even larger indirect losses to holders due to\nreduced confidence in the safety of the Bitcoin system.\n\nOne step developers have taken in the past to ensure widespread adoption\nof new consensus rules is programming in a delay between the time software\nwith those rules is expected to be released and when the software starts\ntracking which blocks signal for activation.  For example:\n\n    Soft fork        | Release    | Start      | Delta \n    -----------------+------------+------------+----------\n    BIP68 (v0.12.1)  | 2016-04-15 | 2016-05-11 | 26 days \n    BIP141 (v0.13.1) | 2016-10-27 | 2016-11-18 | 24 days\n\n    Sources: BitcoinCore.org, https://gist.github.com/ajtowns/1c5e3b8bdead01124c04c45f01c817bc\n\nSpeedy Trial replaces most of that upfront delay with a backend delay.\nNo matter how fast taproot's activation threshold is reached by miners,\nthere will be six months between the time signal tracking starts and when\nnodes will begin enforcing taproot's rules.  This gives the userbase even\nmore time to upgrade than if we had used the most recently proposed start\ndate for a BIP8 activation (~July 23rd).[2] \n\n### Succeed, or fail fast\n\nThe earlier version of this proposal was documented over 200 days ago[3]\nand taproot's underlying code was merged into Bitcoin Core over 140 days\nago.[4]  If we had started Speedy Trial at the time taproot\nwas merged (which is a bit unrealistic), we would've either be less than\ntwo months away from having taproot or we would have moved on to the\nnext activation attempt over a month ago.\n\nInstead, we've debated at length and don't appear to be any closer to\nwhat I think is a widely acceptable solution than when the mailing list\nbegan discussing post-segwit activation schemes over a year ago.[5]  I\nthink Speedy Trial is a way to generate fast progress that will either\nend the debate (for now, if activation is successful) or give us some\nactual data upon which to base future taproot activation proposals.\n\nOf course, for those who enjoy the debate, discussion can continue while\nwaiting for the results of Speedy Trial.\n\n### Base activation protocol\n\nThe idea can be implemented on top of either Bitcoin Core's existing\nBIP9 code or its proposed BIP8 patchset.[6]\n\n- BIP9 uses two time-based[7] parameters, starttime and timeout.  Using\n  these values plus a time-based parameter for the minimum activation\n  delay would give three months for miners to activate taproot, but some\n  of that time near the start or the end might not be usable due to\n  signals only being measured in full retarget periods.  However, the\n  six month time for users to upgrade their node would be not be\n  affected by either slow or fast block production.\n  \n    BIP9 is already part of Bitcoin Core and I think the changes being\n    proposed would be relatively small, resulting in a small patch that\n    could be easy to review.\n\n- BIP8 uses two height-based parameters, startheight and timeoutheight.\n  Using height values would ensure miners had a certain number of\n  retarget periods (6) to lock in taproot and that there'd be a certain\n  number of blocks (about 24,000) until activation, although latest lock\n  in and expected activation could occur moderately earlier or later\n  than the estimated three and six months.\n  \n    BIP8 would likely be used if Speedy Trial fails, so it could be\n    advantageous to base this proposal on BIP8 so that we gain\n    experience running that code in production.\n\nFor additional discussion about using times versus heights, see today's\nlog for ##taproot-activation.[11]\n\n### Additional concerns\n\n- Encourages false signaling: false signaling is when miners signal\n  readiness to enforce rules that their nodes don't actually support.\n  This was partially responsible for a six-block reorg shortly after the\n  final BIP66 activation[8] and was found to still be a problem during\n  the BIP68 lockin period despite BIP9 being designed to avoid it.[9]\n\n  Because Speedy Trial only gives miners a maximum of three months to\n  signal support for taproot, it may encourage such false signaling.  If\n  taproot locks in as a result of their signaling but most of them fail\n  to upgrade by the activation date several months later, unprepared\n  miners could lose large amounts of money and users could see long\n  reorgs (with unupgraded nodes and SPV lite clients potentially losing\n  money).\n\n  Compared to other activation proposals, I think the only difference is\n  Speedy Trial's short timeline.  False signaling is possible with any\n  other proposal and the same problems can occur if miners fail to\n  upgrade for any mandatory activation.\n\n### Additional advantages\n\n- No mandatory signaling: at no time are miners required to signal by\n  Speedy Trial.  This includes no mandatory signaling during the\n  locked_in period(s), although such signaling will be encouraged (as it\n  was with BIP9[10]).\n\n- Party time: to a lesser degree, a benefit mentioned for flag day\n  activation may also apply here: we could get up to six months\n  advanced notice of taproot activation, allowing users, developers, and\n  organizations to prepare software, announcements, and celebrations for\n  that event.\n\n## Implementation details and next steps\n\nInitial discussion about implementation may be found in today's\n##taproot-activation log.[11] If it appears Speedy Trial may have\ntraction, Russell O'Connor has offered to work on a patch against BIP8\nimplementing it.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe original idea for a short-duration attempt was discussed in the\n##taproot-activation IRC channel last July and the revised idea saw\nadditional evaluation there this week.

This gives the userbase even\n> more time to upgrade than if we had used the most recently proposed start\n> date for a BIP8 activation (~July 23rd).[2]\n>\n> ### Succeed, or fail fast\n>\n> The earlier version of this proposal was documented over 200 days ago[3]\n> and taproot's underlying code was merged into Bitcoin Core over 140 days\n> ago.[4]  If we had started Speedy Trial at the time taproot\n> was merged (which is a bit unrealistic), we would've either be less than\n> two months away from having taproot or we would have moved on to the\n> next activation attempt over a month ago.\n>\n> Instead, we've debated at length and don't appear to be any closer to\n> what I think is a widely acceptable solution than when the mailing list\n> began discussing post-segwit activation schemes over a year ago.[5]  I\n> think Speedy Trial is a way to generate fast progress that will either\n> end the debate (for now, if activation is successful) or give us some\n> actual data upon which to base future taproot activation proposals.\n>\n> Of course, for those who enjoy the debate, discussion can continue while\n> waiting for the results of Speedy Trial.\n>\n> ### Base activation protocol\n>\n> The idea can be implemented on top of either Bitcoin Core's existing\n> BIP9 code or its proposed BIP8 patchset.[6]\n>\n> - BIP9 uses two time-based[7] parameters, starttime and timeout.  Using\n>    these values plus a time-based parameter for the minimum activation\n>    delay would give three months for miners to activate taproot, but some\n>    of that time near the start or the end might not be usable due to\n>    signals only being measured in full retarget periods.  However, the\n>    six month time for users to upgrade their node would be not be\n>    affected by either slow or fast block production.\n>\n>      BIP9 is already part of Bitcoin Core and I think the changes being\n>      proposed would be relatively small, resulting in a small patch that\n>      could be easy to review.\n>\n> - BIP8 uses two height-based parameters, startheight and timeoutheight.\n>    Using height values would ensure miners had a certain number of\n>    retarget periods (6) to lock in taproot and that there'd be a certain\n>    number of blocks (about 24,000) until activation, although latest lock\n>    in and expected activation could occur moderately earlier or later\n>    than the estimated three and six months.\n>\n>      BIP8 would likely be used if Speedy Trial fails, so it could be\n>      advantageous to base this proposal on BIP8 so that we gain\n>      experience running that code in production.\n>\n> For additional discussion about using times versus heights, see today's\n> log for ##taproot-activation.[11]\n>\n> ### Additional concerns\n>\n> - Encourages false signaling: false signaling is when miners signal\n>    readiness to enforce rules that their nodes don't actually support.\n>    This was partially responsible for a six-block reorg shortly after the\n>    final BIP66 activation[8] and was found to still be a problem during\n>    the BIP68 lockin period despite BIP9 being designed to avoid it.[9]\n>\n>    Because Speedy Trial only gives miners a maximum of three months to\n>    signal support for taproot, it may encourage such false signaling.  If\n>    taproot locks in as a result of their signaling but most of them fail\n>    to upgrade by the activation date several months later, unprepared\n>    miners could lose large amounts of money and users could see long\n>    reorgs (with unupgraded nodes and SPV lite clients potentially losing\n>    money).\n>\n>    Compared to other activation proposals, I think the only difference is\n>    Speedy Trial's short timeline.  False signaling is possible with any\n>    other proposal and the same problems can occur if miners fail to\n>    upgrade for any mandatory activation.\n>\n> ### Additional advantages\n>\n> - No mandatory signaling: at no time are miners required to signal by\n>    Speedy Trial.  This includes no mandatory signaling during the\n>    locked_in period(s), although such signaling will be encouraged (as it\n>    was with BIP9[10]).\n>\n> - Party time: to a lesser degree, a benefit mentioned for flag day\n>    activation may also apply here: we could get up to six months\n>    advanced notice of taproot activation, allowing users, developers, and\n>    organizations to prepare software, announcements, and celebrations for\n>    that event.\n>\n> ## Implementation details and next steps\n>\n> Initial discussion about implementation may be found in today's\n> ##taproot-activation log.[11] If it appears Speedy Trial may have\n> traction, Russell O'Connor has offered to work on a patch against BIP8\n> implementing it.\n>\n> ## Acknowledgments\n>\n> The original idea for a short-duration attempt was discussed in the\n> ##taproot-activation IRC channel last July and the revised idea saw\n> additional evaluation there this week.

Activation is delayed\nuntil the first retarget period where the final block of the previous\nretarget period has a timestamp of at least October 1st.\n\nNote that the timeout there is prior to the expected timestamp of the\nstartheight block specified in the proposal for bip8 parameters:\n\n  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposal_202102\n\nand earliest activation is after the expected release of 22.0 and hence\nthe maintenance end of 0.20.\n\nNote also that the PR above specifies the delay as a deadline, not a\ndelta between lockin and activation; so earlier lockin does not produce\nan earlier activation with the code referenced above.\n\nCheers,\naj"

Which\nis mostly fine, but if this group gets near 51% mining support in the\nthree months it will embolden them to switch the messaging from\n\"upgrade the client\" to \"run this new client that has the LOT flag\nswitched to true\" (UASF)\nThis marketing group will attempt a UASF regardless of the timelines\nbecause there is no cost if they fail a UASF and there is great reward\nif they succeed by activating in 3 months. They can run an alt-node,\nscare everyone else of being reorged, pretend they have a majority,\nand say their chain is the safe one. I say there is no cost because\nthe leaders of that movement are likely savvy enough to give up the\neffort and move back to running core even after the chain split. The\nones who get hurt are the followers of the UASF movement that don't\nfully understand the discussion and drink the kool aid.\nA short time window doesn't preclude this group from attempting a UASF.\n\n> One alternative may be to reduce the signaling windows involved and start slightly later.

Which makes the\nactivation period dangerous because it forces the other miners (20%\n30% 40%) to upgrade really suddenly once the threshold is reached.\nUnless the LOCKED_IN period is made really long (1 year) but then we\nhave to wait a really long time.\nAs long as the mining power running the soft fork is above 50% the\nchain will stay together. Anything above that is just a safety margin\nto prevent orphan blocks.\n\nSo why not encode this 50%+ dynamic into the activation logic.\nSpread the deployment window out to a year, make the activation\nthreshold 95%, and at the end of the window the feature can activate\nif there is above 51% signaling.\nBy definition, the activation will happen if either 95% is reached\nearly or if at the end of the deployment window mining support is\nbetween 51% and 95%. With this setup the chain is guaranteed to stay\ntogether and no need to rush miners and users.\n\nCheers\nAriel Lorenzo-Luaces\n\n>\n> On 3/5/21 22:43, David A.

Instead, a three month window is certainly long enough to\norganize and make a lot of noise around such an effort, given BIP 148 was\norganized and reached its peak within a similar such window.\n\nI'm not sure either. I can't control anyone other than myself. I think (and\nLuke has also stated on IRC) that trying a UASF (LOT=true) during a \"Speedy\nTrial\" deployment would be crazy. I would certainly recommend no one tries\nthat but I can't stop anyone. I'll repeat that soft forks have and always\nwill contain some limited chain split risk regardless of activation\nmechanism. I think you are well intentioned but I'm not sure if you've\nfully grasped that yet. Maybe you have and I'm missing something.\n\n> Worse, because the obvious alternative after a three month activation\nfailure is a significant delay prior to activation, the vocal UASF minority\nmay be encouraged to pursue such a route to avoid such a delay.\n\nAgain I can only speak for myself but I wouldn't support a UASF until this\n\"fail fast\" Speedy Trial has completed and failed. Luke agrees with that\nand other people (eg proofofkeags) on the ##uasf IRC channel have also\nsupported this \"Speedy Trial\" proposal. If you want me (or anyone else for\nthat matter) to guarantee there won't be an attempted UASF during a Speedy\nTrial deployment obviously nobody can do that. All I can say is that\npersonally I won't support one.\n\n> One alternative may be to reduce the signaling windows involved and start\nslightly later. Instead of the likelihood of failure growing on the\nhorizon, simply have two signaling windows (maybe two weeks, maybe a moth\neach?). In order to ensure success remains likely, begin them somewhat\nlater after software release to give pools and miners a chance to configure\ntheir mining software in advance.\n\nThe parameters for Speedy Trial are being hammered out on IRC as we speak.\nI'd encourage you to engage with those discussions. I'd really like to\navoid a scenario where we have broad consensus on the details of Speedy\nTrial and then you come out the woodwork weeks later with either an\nalternative proposal or a criticism for how the details of Speedy Trial\nwere finalized.\n\nI've read your email as you're concerned about a UASF during a Speedy Trial\ndeployment. Other than that I think (?) you support it and you are free to\njoin the discussion on IRC if you have particular views on parameters.\nPersonally I don't think those parameters should be chosen assuming there\nwill be a UASF during the deployment but you can argue that case on IRC if\nyou wish. All proposals you have personally put forward suffer from chain\nsplit risk in the face of a competing incompatible activation mechanism.\n\n\n-- \nMichael Folkson\nEmail: michaelfolkson at gmail.com\nKeybase: michaelfolkson\nPGP: 43ED C999 9F85 1D40 EAF4 9835 92D6 0159 214C FEE3\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210306/fe5ea3fe/attachment.html>"

Nor is having a discussion with under a few days latency \"coming out of the wordwork weeks later\". \nFrankly, I find this more than a little insulting.

                "message_text_only": "Hi,\n\nGiven recent discussions around possible cracks to RSA, ECDSA and even sha256 we have been looking at possible options for hardening Bitcoin against those potential attack vectors. While most consider it a low priority, IMO it is better to discuss this issue than ignore it especially given recent developments. Possible solutions may not be quick to implement, test, deploy and prevention is better than the cure.\n\nWe humbly present a few seeds of ideas which might be viable defenses. These are not deeply thought out at the technical level but may inspire some useful discussion for a few new BIPs.\n\nWe have discussed these ideas in private before submitting to shake out weaknesses. We are aware that the ideas are challenging and probably contentious. We are not seeking didruption. The goal is to defeat potential attacks. Apologies if these ideas are not new and have already been dismissed.\n\nPossible defense strategies:\n\n1. Alternate hashing methods. Not sha256. Exposing them sooner rather than later to enable a smooth transition.\n\n2. Per address seed phrases. In addiition to mulitisig, segwit, P2SH, schnorr, taproot.\n\n3. Removing private keys from a wallet for safe storage in a seperate location.\n\n4. Completely removing wallets from the blockchain for 'absolute' cold storage*. If possible there would no longer be any trace of the wallet or associated addresses. Possibly in combination with the next suggestion.\n\n- Bonus for general maintenance.\n\n5. Burning old coins and generating 'new' coins to 'reset' tx history.\n\nA 'Burn and Reissue' FIFO queue with set miner fees. Satoshis submitted to the queue are permanently 'disabled and no longer in use. Replacement satoshis are added to new blocks and distributed by queue priority. Suggest a set fee to avoid excessively high processessing fees and/or getting stuck in the queue.\n\n* We realise this would require some significant changes that may not be technically possible.\n\n--\nPatrick Shirkey\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210306/cb59c212/attachment.html>"

Mining pool distribution in last 24 hours:\n\nBinance - 16%\nF2Pool - 15%\nHuobi - 11%\nAntPool - 10%\nViaBTC - 10%\nPoolin - 9%\nBTC.com - 8%\n\nThis is 80% and things are not really different even if look at last 2 weeks. Most of the pools have been reusing address for coinbase transaction and sharing name in coinbase text.\u00a0\n\nTheir opinion on \"Taproot\":\u00a0https://taprootactivation.com/\n\nI won't comment on the origin of these mining pools or history. Maybe things will improve with Stratum v2, lets look at miners but its difficult to know the exact location of miners considering no such details in protocol and people can use Tor, VPN, proxy etc. Mining pools can be non-KYC or have their own understanding with miners. Few countries increased their involvement in Bitcoin mining recently and governments:\n\nRussia\nIran\nVenezuela\nPakistan\n\nChina, US and few others are already involved from  years. Maybe others that we don't know and were not highlighted in mainstream media. What are the risks and rewards involved in bitcoin mining:\n\nRewards:\n\n Block reward (6.25 BTC right now) + transaction fees\nFreedom to include transactions (can censor few transactions if they want)\nInvolved in signaling for soft forks (Bitcoin Development)\n\nRisks:\n\nBTCUSD (Can be hedged)\nHashrate and Difficulty (Can be hedged)\n\nWhat are the opportunities we provide when mining pools (businesses) are asked to agree/disagree on some soft fork, follow with communication and then signaling?\n\nPolitics and misinformation for few months or years\nForked coin as add-on in some cases\nDelay Bitcoin development\nMaybe convince everyone Bitcoin needs no improvement\nOthers\nWho can sponsor for the above mentioned things?\n\nGovernment\nScammers with money and time who were even able to remove whitepaper\nAltcoin foundations\nIs this FUD? No. These are possible issues related to mining pools and we need to plan accordingly. Many people are concerned about UASF and prefer future markets. I don't agree with them and reasons are simple. Changes in Bitcoin Protocol doesn't need futures markets or tokens, both can be easily manipulated by traders and exchanges to make profits. Where is the \"Adversarial Thinking\" involved in changing Bitcoin Protocol and considering involvement of mining pools?\n\nAlready a long email so will share the link to a recent question I asked on \"Bitcoin\" Stackexchange about identifying which mining pool mined a block:\u00a0https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/103409/identify-which-mining-pool-mined-a-block\n\nI am hopeful things will improve and interested to contribute more. Will be helpful if someone could also answer why do we have 30% vulnerable nodes in Bitcoin network?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lb6dpi/vulnerable_bitcoin_nodes/\n\nThanks.\n\nWill end the email on a positive note with something that inspires me a lot:\n\nSatoshi's lesson is that you don't need to be the next Einstein in order to change the world. Nor do you need to have much money, or influence with the world's \"movers & shakers\". You just need to put in the effort. Satoshi, probably just an ordinary hobbyist like anyone here, saw that something was lacking in the Universe, and he fought tooth-and-nail for 2+ years until this imperfection was corrected. This is what makes Satoshi and his work my greatest inspiration.\n \nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5092492.0\n-- \n Prayank\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210310/4166cdc0/attachment-0001.html>"

                "message_text_only": "I'm aware that some folks (I think nullc, sipa, myself... maybe more?) are\naware of how to do script delegation in Bitcoin today (without any\nmodifications to Bitcoin), but realized in a conversation with Andrew P\nthat the technique is not widely known. So I figured it made sense to do a\nbrief explainer of how this works for the archives / so the technique is\ndocumented. If someone has other citations for this, please respond below.\n\nIf you like cartoons follow along here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ikcthy3p-Ah59pJyss0TLEj-Q2FF6tv7BXhkORzErAE/edit#slide=id.p\n\nTechnically what we are doing is delegating a UTXO to a specific UTXO, and\nnot to a script.\n\n\nSuppose you have a coin on UTXO A. You would like to delegate it to script\nS. You can either scan the chain for any UTXOs bound to S or use some\narbitrary coin B to create a transaction X with an output D that has script\nS (doesn't have to have any value, but let's say it has a nominal amount to\navoid dust issues). Because tx X is not malleable, we don't need to\nactually broadcast it and spend B till we want to use the delegation, and\nit can be created (for the TXID) without B's owner being online. However\nyou get the UTXO, and if it exists or not yet, let's call it D.\n\n*Note: if you're using a delegation script multiple times, you can optimize\nthe creation step a bit*\n\nNow, using A, you sign a transaction with 2 inputs (one of them being D)\nand SIGHASH_NONE. This signs all of the inputs (but not their sequences!)\nbut none of the outputs. Let's call this transaction stub G.\n\nNow, using S, you sign D's input on G with SIGHASH_ALL and the outputs you\nwant to create (whatever they may be). Let's call the finished transaction\nF.\n\nEffectively, the holder of A has delegated the control of their coin to a\nspecific instance of the script S. Once delegated, S may authorize almost\nany transaction they want (complicated if they want to sign a multiple\ninput transaction; but there are good substitutes).\n\nAdvanced Topics:\n\n*Revocation*: There are multiple ways to revoke, either moving A, moving D,\nrefusing to sign and create D (when D is derived from B), etc. Because\nthese are UTXO-bound they are revocable. (the cartoon may help here)\n*Cross input delegation*: A set of N coins may create a sighash_none\ntransaction with 1 additional input for the delegating script\n*Partial Spending Authorizations*: Replacing sighash_none with\nsighash_single allows an input to specify a single change address (plug --\nOP_CTV covenants can be thought of as a way to get around sighash_single to\nallow sighash_single to cover signing a set of outputs)\n*Delegation after time*: Because the lock_time field is covered,\ndelegations can be set up to only be valid at some point in the future.\nOnly a single sequence lock per delegated coin may be used directly.\n*Multiple Delegates: *By signing a txn with several delegate outputs, it is\npossible to enforce multiple disparate conditions. Normally this is\nsuperfluous -- why not just concatenate S1 and S2? The answer is that you\nmay have S1 require a relative height lock and S2 require a relative time\nlock (this was one of the mechanisms investigated for powswap.com).\n*Sequenced Contingent Delegation*: By constructing a specific TXID that may\ndelegate the coins, you can make a coin's delegation contingent on some\nother contract reaching a specific state. For example, suppose I had a\ncontract that had 100 different possible end states, all with fixed\noutpoints at the end. I could delegate coins in different arrangements to\nbe claimable only if the contract reaches that state. Note that such a\nmodel requires some level of coordination between the main and observing\ncontract as each Coin delegate can only be claimed one time.\n*CTV Specific P2SH Non Coin Delegation: *OP_CTV allows for a similar form\nof delegation where by a Segwit P2SH address, as a part of the CTV\ncommitted data, can be used without binding it to any specific UTXO. With\nthe addition of OP_CAT, it would be possible to both programmatically\nchange the outputs (rather than just approving the fixed txn) and to\ndynamically select the script.\n*Redelegating: *This is where A delegates to S, S delegates to S'. This\ntype of mechanism most likely requires the coin to be moved on-chain to the\nscript (A OR S or S'), but the on-chain movement may be delayed (via\npresigned transactions) until S' actually wants to do something with the\ncoin.\n\nThere are obviously many other things you can do with delegation in\ngeneral, the above are specific to how coin delegation is done. I'm\nprobably missing some of the fun stuff -- please riff on this!\n\nBest,\n\nJeremy\n\n--\n@JeremyRubin <https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210310/b7929d50/attachment.html>"

Otherwise you need to know exactly what you\nwant beforehand.\n\nI'd note that you can also achieve a decent amount of scripting capability\nfor fully pre-signed transactions using layered encryption. E.g., given\nscript Checksig(Alice) and Checksig(Bob), you can delegate to\n2 of CheckMulti(Carol, Dave, Eve) by (for example) encrypting either a\npresigned txn or the actual sk's themselves with enc(Carol, enc(Dave, m)),\nenc(Carol, enc(Eve, m)), enc(Dave, enc(Eve, m)). This allows you to\npost-hoc delegate a presigned (or the keys -- which may or may not be safe\nif they are from a HD wallet mind you). You can also do a variant of\ntimelock encryption by encrypting m using a verifiable delay function (this\nactually permits a new kind of relative lock, depending on where you layer\nthe VDF enc, which would be N seconds from when the two parties agree to\ndecrypt). The general protocol can also be optimized by giving Carol\nenc(Dave, m) and enc(Eve) but then you have to have a confidential channel\nto each delegate. You can also do a ZKCP type thing if you prove that a txn\nmatching a specific format is encrypted with the preimage to a hash.\nThere's a lot you can do as improvement on simple \"hand the key\" -- this\nsounds kinda similar to scriptless scripts?\n\nW.r.t. privacy, it certainly is a hit. But I think in situations where\nprivacy is a goal, then the delegation can contact the original signer and\nask to cooperate. However in some circumstances that won't be viable given\naccess to keys or whatnot. I would suggest in these cases that you can do a\nhybrid: delegate to a script and provide a default sighash_all txn, and a\nmodifiable sighash_none/single. Then the delegates can decide what is best\nto use and optimistically get the originals to sign off.\n\nInterestingly, there is a subset of cases where it is desirable to have\nprivacy *from the original script holder*. Conceivably the tx does need to\nbe public at some point, but for interest, once delegated to from S to S',\nS' could show a signature covering a txn hash from S', and request that S\nsign it. S' can reveal partial information -- e.g., which inputs are being\nspent, but not which outputs are being created. Maybe not super useful, but\nit is interesting to note of course.\n\nBest,\n\nJeremy\n--\n@JeremyRubin <https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n\n\nOn Tue, Mar 16, 2021 at 1:36 AM ZmnSCPxj <ZmnSCPxj at protonmail.com> wrote:\n\n> Good morning Jeremy,\n>\n> Thank you.\n>\n> Assuming only keys, an easier way of delegating would be simply to give a\n> copy of the privkey outright to the delegatee.\n>\n> However, an advantage of this technique you described is that the\n> delegator can impose additional restrictions that are programmable via any\n> SCRIPT, an ability that merely handing over the privkey cannot do.\n> Thus the technique has an ability that mere handover cannot achieve.\n>\n> If the delegatee is a known single entity, and S is simply the delegatee\n> key plus some additional restrictions, it may be possible to sign with\n> `SIGHASH_ALL` a transaction that spends A and D, and outputs to a singlesig\n> of the delegatee key.\n> This would avoid the use of `SIGHASH_NONE`, for a mild improvement in\n> privacy.\n> The output would still allow the delegatee to dispose of the funds by its\n> unilateral decision subject to the fulfillment of the script S (at the cost\n> of yet another transaction).\n> On the other hand, if S is unusual enough, the enhanced privacy may be\n> moot (the S already marks the transaction as unusual), so this variation\n> has little value.\n>\n> In terms of offchain technology, if the delegator remains online, the\n> delegatee may present a witness satisfying S to the delegator, and ask the\n> delegator to provide an alternate transaction that spends A directly\n> without spending D and outputs to whatever the delegatee wants.\n> The delegator cannot refuse since the delegatee can always use the\n> `SIGHASH_NONE` signature and spend to whatever it decides provided it can\n> present a witness satisfying S.\n> This is basically a typical \"close transaction\" for layer 2 technology.\n> On the other hand, one generalized use-case for delegation would be if the\n> delegator suspects it may not be online or able to sign with the delegator\n> key, so this variation has reduced value as well.\n>\n> Regards,\n> ZmnSCPxj\n>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210316/db4de0e9/attachment-0001.html>"

                "message_text_only": "Hello,\n\nI am working on a draft BIP for a signature and script independent hierarchy for deterministic wallets.\n\nI believe with the implementation of descriptor wallets, the typical use case of of a BIP43 `purpose\u2019` level per script type is redundant. The differentiation of separate BIPs for multisignature derivation paths, with BIP45 and \u201cBIP\u201d 48, is also redundant \u2013 with path levels such as `cosigner_index` and `script_type`. Descriptors can set the order of the public keys with `multi` or have them sorted lexicographically with `sortedmulti`.\n\nI don\u2019t believe we should be mixing keys and scripts in the same layer. The wallet should create extended private/public keys independent of the script or signature type, whereas the descriptor language tells wallets to watch (single or multi-sig) outputs with the specified public keys.\n\nThe BIP defines the following 5 levels in the BIP32 path:\n\nm / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index\n\nIt is crucial that the `account\u2019` level is increased for each new wallet joined or private/public keys created; for both privacy and cryptographic purposes. For example, in multisignature wallets, before sending a new key record to a coordinator, the wallet must increment the `account\u2019` level. Before creating it's own single signature wallet, the `account\u2019` level must again be incremented. This prevents key reuse - across single signature and multisignature wallets, across ECDSA and Schnorr signatures, and inbetween the same wallet types.\n\nFor full details, please see the BIP here: https://github.com/Rspigler/bips-1/blob/Sane_Mulitisg_deriv/Modern%20Derivation%20Standard.mediawiki\n\nPlease see the PR here: https://github.com/Rspigler/bips-1/pull/1\n\nLooking forward to comments.\n\nThank you,\n\nRobert Spigler\n\nPersonal Fingerprint: BF0D 3C08 A439 5AC6 11C1 5395 B70B 4A77 F850 548F\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210314/1cdda930/attachment.html>"

Read the section account recovery closely to see how it's done.  No\npublic keys or derivation paths needed, as the derivation path can just be\nenumerated and for single signature wallets you don't need external public\nkeys. Similarly a BIP39/BIP44/BIP49/BIP84 can recover all these accounts\nusing just the seed words and for example the Trezor Suite does this.  Most\nhardware wallets currently rely on this feature, as they don't store any\nadditional information like output descriptors (which would be possible,\nbut would make regular backups necessary).  Of course, autodiscover doesn't\nwork for multisig wallets, unless you would store some output descriptor in\nan OP_RETURN on the blockchain.\n\nIt's okay to make a new standard that requires regular backups, but you\nshould at least keep in mind that this complicates some use cases.\n\n  Jochen\n\n\nOn Tue, 16 Mar 2021 at 13:19, Robert Spigler via bitcoin-dev <\nbitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n\n> No, wallets don't and shouldn't have to check all script types on\n> recovery.

Most wallets today that allow you to\nrestore with just a seed by deriving the keys for that seed in the BIP32\npaths the wallet supports (i.e, including the purpose field) and then\nscanning for outputs paying addresses derived from those keys.\n\nIf you try entering your seed into a different wallet (or one that's not\nmaintaining backwards compatibility with earlier versions of itself), it\nwon't necessarily support the same addresses you used earlier and so may\nnot work even if it fully supports BIP44 in principle. You'll need to\nuse different software and may need to tell that software the addresses\nand paths your previous software used.\n\nUnder this proposed standard, I don't think any of that changes. If you\ntry to restore a seed into the same wallet that created it, it can scan\nfor the address types it supports. A different or\nbackwards-incompatible wallet may not work and you may need to find\nsoftware that can handle your old address type and specific path\ninformation, which descriptors (and miniscript) makes easier.\n\nThe way I see it, there's not really a change to the information the\nuser needs to record for the normal case (seed phrase + name of software\nused) or the unusual case (seed phrase + address types + paths).\n\nWhere I think this new proposal excels is in handling multisigs, where\nthe user needs to record the other signers' keys anyway. In those\ncases, the fairly small overhead of descriptors compared to a minimalist\nencoding is worth descriptor's benefits of providing an error detection\ncode and BIP32 fingerprints/paths that allow key location.\n\n> 2.

Let's say the Foo Wallet v1 used P2PKH\nand v2 defaulted to P2WPKH (but still allowed spending from P2PKH).\nUser Alice started with v1, so Foo Wallet gave her addresses,\n\npkh([a11ce000/XY'/0'/0'/0/0])\npkh([a11ce000/XY'/0'/0'/0/1])\npkh([a11ce000/XY'/0'/0'/0/...])\n\nWhen she upgraded to v2, it gave her the following new addresses (note\nthe antepenultimate path level (the account level) is incremented):\n\nwpkh([a11ce000/XY'/0'/1'/0/0])\nwpkh([a11ce000/XY'/0'/1'/0/1])\nwpkh([a11ce000/XY'/0'/1'/0/...])\n\nNow we consider Bob who started with the v2 version of the wallet that\ndefaulted to P2WPKH. His addresses are:\n\nwpkh([b0bb10c5/XY'/0'/0'/0/0])\nwpkh([b0bb10c5/XY'/0'/0'/0/1])\nwpkh([b0bb10c5/XY'/0'/0'/0/...])\n\nThis means that, when Alice restores from backup, the wallet looks\nthrough the zeroeth account to see if it finds any P2PKH outputs; when it\ndoes, it also checks the first account to see if there are any P2WPKH\noutputs. When Bob restores from backup, it scans for P2PKH, doesn't find\nany, scans fro P2WPH and finds them.\n\n> It is good not to reuse keys.

Is that your concern?\n\nI agree, that's a problem. I'll have to think about that (and maybe Robert\nalready has).\n\n-Dave\n\n******************\n\nghost43 clarifies concerns:\n\nConsider Carol, who creates 5 pkh accounts, then creates 1 wpkh account, then 1 wpkh-sh account, then 2 more wpkh (9 accounts overall).\n\nIf Carol is using BIP44/49/84, she will then have used:\n- BIP44 account indices 0-4 inclusive,\n- BIP49 account index 0,\n- BIP84 account indices 0-2\n\nIf using new BIP XY, she will then have used:\n- BIPXY account indices 0-4 for p2pkh\n- BIPXY account index 5 for p2wpkh\n- BIPXY account index 6 for p2wpkh-p2sh\n- BIPXY account indices 7-8 for p2wpkh\n\nThe issue is that when restoring, with BIPXY, the wallet software will have to try all script types for all account indices: if it does not find an account, it might stop there, and miss all subsequent accounts too.\n\nIf using BIP44/49/84, when restoring, the wallet will scan:\n- for p2pkh, BIP44, indices 0-5, stopping at 5 as it has not been used: scanned 5 accounts worth of addresses (+1 extra address for account idx 5)\n- for p2wpkh-p2sh, BIP49, indices 0 and 1, stopping at 1 as it has not been used: scanned 1 account worth of addresses (+1 extra address for account idx 1)\n- for p2wpkh, BIP84, indices 0-3, stopping at idx 3 as it has not been used: scanned 3 accoutns worth of addresses (+1 extra address for account idx 3)\nAll together the wallet needs to scan ~9 accounts worth of addresses which matches the 9 accounts the user actually created.\n\nIf using new BIP XY, when restoring, the wallet will scan:\n- address index 0, hmmm wonder what script type the user might have used here, let's try p2wpkh as that is the cool thing today... --- ends up trying all script types (in worst case) until it finds p2pkh\n- address index 1, hmmm surely the user used the new script type by then? tries all script types in worst case again\n- ...\nAll together the wallet might end up scanning 9 * n (maybe three for now; but what about p2pk; or p2tr?) accounts worth of addresses.\n\nghost43\n\n***********\n\nghost43 clarifies further:\n\n> If using new BIP XY, she will then have used:\n> - BIPXY account indices 0-4 for p2pkh\n> - BIPXY account index 5 for p2wpkh\n> - BIPXY account index 6 for p2wpkh-p2sh\n> - BIPXY account indices 7-8 for p2wpkh\n\n> The issue is that when restoring, with BIPXY, the wallet software will have to try all script types for all account indices: if it does not find an account, it might stop there, and miss all subsequent accounts too.\n\nIn fact note that if an older wallet does not support p2wpkh; only p2pkh and p2wpkh-p2sh, it only find accounts 0-4, and miss account 6.\nThis is a regression compared to BIP44/49.\n\n**********\n\nDavid Replies:\n\nOn Thu, Mar 18, 2021 at 12:22:48AM +0000, SomberNight wrote:\n> > If using new BIP XY, she will then have used:\n> > - BIPXY account indices 0-4 for p2pkh\n> > - BIPXY account index 5 for p2wpkh\n> > - BIPXY account index 6 for p2wpkh-p2sh\n> > - BIPXY account indices 7-8 for p2wpkh\n>\n> > The issue is that when restoring, with BIPXY, the wallet software will have to try all script types for all account indices: if it does not find an account, it might stop there, and miss all subsequent accounts too.\n>\n> In fact note that if an older wallet does not support p2wpkh; only p2pkh and p2wpkh-p2sh, it only find accounts 0-4, and miss account 6.\n> This is a regression compared to BIP44/49.\n\nAgreed.

This looks like a hijacking attempt.\nWe are already bombarded with too much information, the last thing we need is\na rushed upgrade. Even if it works out it is not a good precedent.\nThe current timeline of 18 months if the minimum that is acceptable for upgrades\nsuch as taproot.

This is not the time where people need to get involved. There is no need for \nmore noise. People will get involved progressivly as time advances but as long\nas Core does not release the parameters of the game there are no incentives for\nthe actors that will play the Taproot upgrade to show up. If Taproot is what the\nmarket wants then the game theoretics of Bitcoin will get us there but since an\nupgrade essentially means a change in consensus then some disturbance is expected and guaranteed. \nAt this point involve as few people as possible and get it done. This is just about\nthe software and the parameters of the new consesus. Theres plenty of time\nfor the show that's about to come, the market will do what the market does.\n\nWorst case scenario Luke get some people behind and fork off Core with LOT=true and\nlower MAST threshold.

Back in the day we also had people that thought 10 min avg block time is too much.\nTaproot by the end of 2022 *using a single activation method* is not rushed. Taproot\nby 2022 by all means necessary is tyranny.

If you pretend users decide then you will\nunderstand users have others things to do than continously keeping up with Bitcoin\nand in order for them to make an informed decision there needs to be plenty of time.\n\nOtherwise you're repeating the tyranical argument which has become a recurring theme\nof the discourse of some of the Bitcoin Core developers.

The QC discussion starts roughly here:\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-January/015620.html\n\nMy own (very possibly wrong) interpretation of the situation is:\n\n1. Current addresses are very vulnerable to QC and would require hardfork\nto fix (and not fix particularly well).\n2. Once a QC resistant spending procedure has been developed it could be\nadded as a backup spending policy as a new tapleaf version (wallets would\nhave to opt into it).\n3. If QC does get to the point where it can break ECC then we can disable\nkey-path spends via softfork\n4. If everyone has moved their coins to Taproot addresses with a QC\nresistant tapleaf backup then we're ok.\n5. Since the above is almost certainly not going to happen we can simply\ncongratulate the new QC owners on the Bitcoin they take from old addresses\n(specter of QC encourages moving to taproot which could be thought of as a\ngood thing).\n6. Otherwise we have to hard fork to stop old addresses being spent without\na quantum resistant ZKP (oof!).\n7. Once we know what we're up against a new quantum resistant segwit\nversion can be introduced (if it hasn't already).\n8. If QC develop far enough to degrade SHA256 sufficiently (ECC probably\nbreaks first) then that's a whole other ball game since it affects PoW and\ntxids and so on and will likely require a hard fork.\n\nThe ordering of the above events is not predictable. IMO Mark's post is on\nthe wildly optimistic side of projected rate of progress from my limited\nunderstanding. Either way it is strictly better to enter a QC world with\nTaproot enabled and most people are using it so we can introduce QC\nresistant backup spend paths without hardforks before they become\npractical. Depending on what happens they may not be needed but it's good\nto have the option.\n\nOn Tue, 16 Mar 2021 at 10:11, Karl-Johan Alm via bitcoin-dev <\nbitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n\n> On Tue, 16 Mar 2021 at 07:48, Matt Corallo via bitcoin-dev\n> <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> >\n> > Overall, the tradeoffs here seem ludicrous, given that any QC issues in\n> Bitcoin need to be solved in another way, and\n> > can't practically be solved by just relying on the existing hash\n> indirection.\n>\n> The important distinction here is that, with hashes, an attacker has\n> to race against the spending transaction confirming, whereas with\n> naked pubkeys, the attacker doesn't have to wait for a spend to occur,\n> drastically increasing the available time to attack.\n>\n>\nFirst note that I am enthusiastically ignorant of QC technology so please\ntake the following with a bowl of salt.\nThe premise of Mark's post is that QC progress is currently exponential\n(debatable) and will continue to be (unknowable) so \"months\" will turn into\ndays and into minutes in short time period. Since QC progress is\nexponential and the speedup that ECC quantum algorithms offer is\nexponential you're not dealing with the typical \"Moore's law\" progress in\nterms of time to solve a particular problem; It's like exponential\nexponential (math person help me now). You could easily go from ten\nthousand years to break ECC to a few seconds within a year with that rate\nof progress so I don't think \"slow quantum\" is an adversary worth\nprotecting against. I would love to know if I am wrong on this point.\n\nCheers,\n\nLL\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210316/62c7381f/attachment.html>"

Without \nhashes, there is no defense at all (other than sending bitcoins to a \nnon-taproot address and hoping they evade the attack in time).\n\n\nOn Monday 15 March 2021 23:12:18 Andrew Poelstra wrote:\n> \"No gain\" except to save significant CPU time and bandwidth?\n\nThe CPU time is localised to involved nodes, and (correct me if I'm wrong) \ntrivial in comparison to what is required to run a full node in the first \nplace.

If the original key is usable, i.e. a QC\nhas appeared overnight, then Bitcoin is screwed.

Every address which is derived using BIP32\nshould be assumed compromised to a QC attacker because xpubs are not treated\nlike secret key material and are trivial to e.g. extract from hardware wallets\nor PSBTs. I expect the real number is close to 100%.\n\n\nIn any case, Taproot keys, when used according to the recommendation in\nBIP-0341, are already hashes of their internal keys, so (a) Taproot outputs\nactually have better quantum resistance than legacy outputs; and (b) adding\nanother hash would be strictly redundant.\n\n-- \nAndrew Poelstra\nDirector of Research, Blockstream\nEmail: apoelstra at wpsoftware.net\nWeb:   https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew\n\nThe sun is always shining in space\n    -Justin Lewis-Webster\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 488 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210315/386e13df/attachment.sig>"

Other similar\nrisks for Bitcoin exist, such as secret discoveries about how to\ncompromise the hash functions Bitcoin depends on.  One way to help\ncontrol those risks is to pay a public bounty to anyone who provably and\npublicly discloses the secret advance (ideally while allowing the leaker\nto remain anonymous).  Several years ago, Peter Todd created a series of\nBitcoin addresses that does exactly that.[1]\n\nFor example, if you pay 35Snmmy3uhaer2gTboc81ayCip4m9DT4ko, then\nanyone[2] who can prove a collision attack against Bitcoin's primary\nhash function, SHA256, will be able to claim the bitcoins you and other\npeople sent to that address.  Their claim of the funds will publicly\ndemonstrate that someone can create a SHA256 collision, which is an\nattack we currently believe to be impractical.  This system was\ndemonstrated to work about four years ago[3] when the collision bounty\nfor the much weaker SHA1 function was claimed.[4]\n\nWe can already create an output script with a Nothing Up My Sleeve\n(NUMS) point that would provide a trustless bounty to anyone proving the\ncapability to steal any P2PK-style output with secp256k1's 128-bit\nsecurity.  I curious about whether anyone informed about ECC and QC\nknows how to create output scripts with lower difficulty that could be\nused to measure the progress of QC-based EC key cracking.  E.g.,\nNUMS-based ECDSA- or taproot-compatible scripts with a security strength\nequivalent to 80, 96, and 112 bit security.\n\nThat way the people and businesses concerned about QC advances could\nsend a few BTC to those addresses to create a QC early warning system\nthat would allow us to continue confidently working on EC-based\nprotocols for now but also objectively alert us to when we need to shift\nto working on post-QC protocols for the future.\n\nThank you,\n\n-Dave\n\n[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=293382.0\n\n[2] Anyone claiming the reward may need to mine their own transaction to\n    protect it against rewriting.  In the worst case, they may need to\n    mine at a depth of several blocks or share their reward with miners\n    to prevent sniping reorgs.\n\n[3] https://blockstream.info/tx/8d31992805518fd62daa3bdd2a5c4fd2cd3054c9b3dca1d78055e9528cff6adc\n\n[4] To the best of my knowledge, nothing in Bitcoin ever depended\n    significantly on SHA1, and especially not on SHA1 collision\n    resistance, which was known to be weak even in 2009 when Nakamoto\n    first published the Bitcoin software.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 833 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210315/7c7043d8/attachment-0001.sig>"

This is certainly something that the community should\ndiscuss. Looking into this problem is also on my (too long) list of\nresearch problems.\n\nI think IF we arrive at the conclusion that this is a good idea (which\nis possible but not at all clear to me at this point), then one of the\nquestions is whether it's desirable to use something more efficient\nthan a zero-knowledge proof, at the potential cost of committing to a\nreal public key of a simple post-quantum signature scheme. This could\nfor example be a hash-based one-time signature scheme (but something\nmore efficient than the often mentioned Lamport signatures, e.g.,\nWinternitz or W-OTS+ signatures)."

The way it\nworks is to collect all of the Bitcoin outputs which have exposed/known\npublic keys then associate to these keys a Pedersen commitment which commits\nto the outputs' amounts in a homomorphic way.\n\nHomomorphic means that even though the commitments hide what the original\namounts are, anyone can add them together (in some sense) to get a new\ncommitment to the sum of the original amounts.\n\nSo Provisions is essentially a zero-knowledge proof of the following statement\n\n    1. I have a commitment to >100BTC (or whatever)...\n    2. ...which is a sum of commitments of actual UTXO values...\n    3. ...where these UTXOs come from the set of known-public-key UTXOs...\n    4. ...and I am able to sign with the public keys associated to them.\n\nwhich proves ownership of some amount of BTC, without revealing which specific\nUTXOs were involved. This zero-knowledge proof can be done fairly efficiently\nby exploiting the structure of EC public keys and Pedersen commitments.\n\n\nUnfortunately, most unspent Bitcoin outputs do not have known public keys,\nwhich means that you can only do a Provisions proof using a small anonymity\nset. However, all Taproot outputs, by virtue of having exposed public keys\n(which is the point under contention in this thread), will be in the set of\nexposed-public-key UTXOs, allowing people to do Provisions proofs where\ntheir anonymity set consists of a large proportion of active coins.\n\n\nBTW, even without Provisions, there are some similar and simpler things you\ncan do with Taproot keys along these lines. See for example\nhttps://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1334240709814136833\n\n\n\n-- \nAndrew Poelstra\nDirector of Research, Blockstream\nEmail: apoelstra at wpsoftware.net\nWeb:   https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew\n\nThe sun is always shining in space\n    -Justin Lewis-Webster\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 488 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210316/a17a0bd9/attachment-0001.sig>"

So let's have a\nlook:\u00a0 You say that offset = SHA256(masterPublicKey || nonce). Is this\npredictable by the attacker?\u00a0\n\nI can't really answer that question because it's not specified how\n\"nonce\" is obtained.\u00a0 Since this is supposed to be a deterministic\nscheme, I see two basic ways: Either the master private key is involved\nin the derivation of \"nonce\" (then \"nonce\" may be unpredictable) or\nit's not (then \"nonce\" is predictable).  \n\nAnother fact that may or not be a problem is that it may be possible to\ncompute a parent private key from the a private key. Again, I can't\ntell because I don't know how nonce is obtained. \t\n\nTaking a step back, BIP 32 addresses all of these concerns. I agree it\ncould be simpler but I don't see a practical necessity to invent a new\nscheme. In any application where this proposal could potentially be\nused, BIP 32 could also be used and it's just good enough.\n\nTim \n\n\n> \n> > On 2021-03-20 11:08:30 user Tim Ruffing <crypto at timruffing.de>\n> > wrote:\n> > > On Fri, 2021-03-19 at 20:46 +0100, vjudeu via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n> > > > is it safe enough to implement it and use in practice?\n> > > \n> > > This may be harsh but I can assure you that a HD wallet scheme\n> > > that can\n> > > be specified in 3 lines (without even specifying what the\n> > > security\n> > > goals are) should not be assumed safe to implement.\n> > > \n> > > Tim \n> > > \n> > > \n> > \n> \n> \n> \n> _______________________________________________\n> bitcoin-dev mailing list\n> bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org\n> https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev"

By default, you can just start from 256-bit zero value and increment it if you want standard derivation path. But optionally it can be something else that is unique, for example username. So, if you have \"0/0/0/0\" derivation path, then you have four nonces with 256-bit zero each time. But if you have '0/\"bitcointalk.org\"/5321992/\"coinlatte\"' derivation path (as mentioned by the author of this scheme), then your first nonce is 256-bit zero value, your second nonce is SHA-256 of \"bitcointalk.org\", which is f245bd5620ee79314f48d9e9641a5406bd03745f6ac516e2801ef6ccbfe40ced, your third nonce is 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000513508 and your fourth nonce is 314870494d3a9136ba0a67ceb33534cbd438e982105d20cc076204c6fc99594d. There is an example in mentioned topic here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5321992.msg56503261#msg56503261\n\n> the master private key is involved in the derivation of \"nonce\" (then \"nonce\" may be unpredictable)\n\nIt is impossible, because having some parent public key should be enough to derive child public keys. But even if you know the nonce, you have no idea what masterPublicKey was used in SHA-256 (that is the thing you are looking for if you try to link addresses together).\n\nTo see how difficult it is to get some parent key from some child key, you can try going up the tree in the mentioned example. SHA-256 empty string is e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855, but if used directly, that leads us to some key starting with 03 prefix, so we should negate it and get 1c4f3bbd6703e3eb65040b37669046da93009b024aad0cef1b3cc57157e388ec. Then, we have our child key 02 a34b99f22c790c4e36b2b3c2c35a36db06226e41c692fc82b8b56ac1c540c5bd and to break this scheme and prove that going to the parent key is possible, we have to find something like this:\n\nmasterPublicKey = attackerPublicKey + SHA256(attackerPublicKey || nonce)\n\n02 a34b99f22c790c4e36b2b3c2c35a36db06226e41c692fc82b8b56ac1c540c5bd = attackerPublicKey + SHA-256(attackerPublicKey || 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)\n\nFor me, it seems that finding attackerPublicKey here is impossible. Of course the absence of solution does not mean that it is secure, but I think it is a good example to show how strong this scheme is.\n\nOn 2021-03-21 22:45:19 user Tim Ruffing <crypto at timruffing.de> wrote:\n> On Sat, 2021-03-20 at 21:25 +0100, vjudeu via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n> > So, things have to be complicated to be secure?\n> \n> Not at all.

Please keep this thread limited to pre-registered comments\nrather than responses to such comments, which will be addressed in the\nmeeting.\n\nFor the meeting this coming Tuesday the plan is to attempt to finalize on:\n\n1. Resolving any outstanding concerns around using a Speedy Trial to\nattempt to activate Taproot that must be addressed.\n\nThere seems to be diverse consensus on ST, as per\nhttps://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/92899f27f1ab30aa2ebee82314f8fe7f#gistcomment-3668460\n.\n\n*As such, please pre-register any concern about any ST variant at all by\nresponding below.*\n\n2. Selecting between start/stop heights and times for a speedy trial.\n\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21392.\n\nThe focus of this discussion should be focused on blocking reasons to not\nuse time based parameters, the code review process, and timelines for being\nable to utilize either activation method.\n\nIt is already a widely acknowledged preference for heights over times from\na blank slate pure technical point of view, this discussion is intended to\nbe more pragmatic about safety, hitting the timelines we want to, and\nshipping code.\n\n*As such, If you wish to advocate for MTP from a blank slate pure technical\npoint of view, please pre-register a comment below so we can adjust the\nagenda ahead of time. *\n\n3. Parameter Selection for start/stop/active points.\n\nShort of resolving height or time based start/stop, a discussion of\nselecting acceptable parameters. We should get agreement on both sets of\nheight or time parameters irrespective of the resolution to 2, so that this\nconversation can proceed independently.\n\nMy personal pre-meeting suggestion to keep the discussion moving is that we\nprimarily discuss based on time (as it is the independent variable), and\nsimply use the next (not previous) starting signalling period based on a\nprojection of 10 minute average blocks from today's date to determine the\nspecific height parameters. *Please pre-register if you have a different\nsuggestion.*\n\n4. Parameter flexibility.\n\nIf we select parameters but, for some reason, need to adjust by a week or\ntwo, does this invalidate all ACKs on parameter selection? Or can we agree\nupon some slack in the timeline to accommodate unforeseen development\nissues.\n\n5. Simultaneous UASF.\n\nThere still seems to be some activity on the front of a simultaneous to ST\nUASF. As this has the potential to derail the meeting if there should be\nUASF at all (which I think is orthogonal to the goals of this meeting), and\ngiven many participants unfamiliarity with the proposal for a UASF,\n*I ask that any issues you wish to raise in this section of the meeting or\npertaining to UASF in a prior section be made in a detailed pre-registered\ncomment. *\n\nI think it is regrettable to place this onus on the UASF organizers, but\nstrong communication to the community about plans and intentions seem to be\nessential and in line with what would be required for a UASF to be safe and\nsuccessful in any case.

I do think we are\nnow at the time where Taproot activation becomes a priority for all those\nwith a stake in Taproot activation.\n\nAlthough these parameters haven't yet been finalized the proposed\n(approximate) startheight is May 1st which is less than 6 weeks away.\n\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018594.html\n\nTherefore I encourage everyone with a stake in Taproot activation to attend\nthis meeting tomorrow (Tuesday 19:00 UTC) and raise any specific concerns\nwith block height vs MTP and proposed timetables as Jeremy suggests before\nthe meeting.\n\nPersonally I think we should avoid the min activation height dragging into\nDecember. November (current proposed is November 13th) seems ideal as to\navoid (admittedly Western) holidays in December and January.

                "message_text_only": "We had a very productive meeting today. Here is a summary of the meeting --\nI've done my best to\nsummarize in an unbiased way. Thank you to everyone who attended.\n\n1. On the use of a speedy trial variant:\n\n- There are no new objections to speedy trial generally.\n- There is desire to know if Rusty retracts or reaffirms his NACK in light\nof the responses.\n- There is an open question of if Rusty's NACK remains if it is\nsufficiently addressed.\n- There is no desire to wait for Rusty's response if he does not respond\n(but please don't leave us in suspense).\n\n\n2. Selecting between heights and MTP:\n\n- There is not robust consensus on either\n- There are two NACKs, one (luke-jr) against MTP, one (jeremyrubin) against\nheight. More on this in\n agenda item 5.\n- No one has an issue with the technical safety of MTP/heights on their own.\n- There is an open question of the additional review required to ensure\nheight based activation is\n safe.\n\n3. Parameter Selection\n\n- There is broad agreement that we should target something like a May 1st\nrelease, with 1 week from rc1\n starttime/startheight, and 3 months + delta stoptime/stopheight (6\nretargetting periods), and an\n activation time of around Nov 15th.\n- If we select heights, it looks like the first signalling period would be\n683424, the stop height\n would be 695520.\n- If we select times, we should target a mid-period MTP. We can shift this\ncloser to release, but\n currently it looks like a 1300 UTC May 7th start time and stop time would\nbe 1300 UTC August 13th.\n- The activation height should be 707616 (about Nov 15th) for either\nproposal.\n\n(please check my math, if anyone is superstitious we can add a day to\ntimes...)\n\n4. Parameter Flexibility\n\n- We may wish to adjust the schedule a little bit -- either back 1 signal,\nor up 1 signal.\n- There's concurrence that regardless of pushing the start or stop dates,\nwe should hold the\n November 15th date steady as slipping past Thanksgiving turns to Christmas\nturns to New Years\n turns to Chinese New Year and we're looking at March as the next date\npeople would want to\n schedule.\n- There's concurrence that as long as we're getting to a release sometime\nin May (with a very strong\n preference for Mid-May as opposed to End of May) that we don't need to\nre-evaluate. There's\n limited belief that we could stretch this into June if needed.\n- There's belief that we should be able to get a release with ST Taproot on\nthe timeline suggested\n by topic 3.\n\n5. Simultaneous UASF*\n\n- luke-jr believes that a UASF client must be able to release before the ST\nclient releases in\n order for people to use it\n- no one else in attendance seemed to share this sentiment, a UASF can\nproceed independently of ST.\n- UASF is compatible with a MTP based ST by selecting whatever height the\nST MTP started at\n (and a stop height farther in the future with LOT).\n- luke-jr NACK of ST MTP: ST with MTP means that UASF must release after ST\nreleases, which limits\n UASF adoption.\n- jeremyrubin NACK of ST Height: if using height means that we'd see a\nmarketed push to launch a\n UASF client before ST is given a chance, ST fails its goal for avoiding\ncontentious forks.\n\n* For the avoidance of doubt, theUASF client would include logic to be\ncompatible with ST's minimum\n activation height and may be variously called a \"UASF\", \"BIP8 LOT=true w/\nminactiveheight for ST\n compatibility\", \"ST + BIP8\", or some other combination of phrases in\ndifferent places\n\nBest,\n\nJeremy\n--\n@JeremyRubin <https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210323/b2033cd8/attachment.html>"

I agree with the vast majority of this.\n\nFor those that missed yesterday's meeting the meeting log is here:\nhttp://gnusha.org/taproot-activation/2021-03-23.log\n\nJeremy also livestreamed the meeting on his Twitch channel:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/960346848\n\nOn the choice between using block heights consistently or using a\nweird mix of both block heights and MTP in the same activation\nmechanism you can put me down for a NACK for the latter also.\n\nIn addition I documented here the preferences for a consistent use of\nblock height:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377#issuecomment-802336038\n\nIf it was a direct choice between entirely block height or entirely\nMTP then I probably wouldn't NACK either. But using a mix of both\nmakes no sense to me.\n\nThe two arguments in favor of using a weird mix of block heights and\nMTP appear to be:\n1) \"additional review required to ensure height based activation\"\n2) To prevent a \"marketed push to launch a UASF client.\"\n\nOn 1) I would argue that the additional review required is not\nexcessive by any means and we have the time to review a consistent use\nof block height (especially if people spent their time reviewing a PR\nwith a consistent use of block height rather than arguing for a mix).\nOn 2) if we are making technical decisions based on speculating on the\nmarketing strategies of other projects Bitcoin Core is a very\ndifferent project to the project I thought it was.\n\nI personally would find it much easier to reason about timings and\ntime intervals of the different activation phases if block heights are\nused consistently across the activation mechanism rather than a weird\nmix of both block heights and MTP.\n\nOther than that, I agree it was an excellent meeting and thanks for\nyour efforts organizing and hosting the meeting.\n\n-- \nMichael Folkson\nEmail: michaelfolkson at gmail.com\nKeybase: michaelfolkson\nPGP: 43ED C999 9F85 1D40 EAF4 9835 92D6 0159 214C FEE3"

There are likely better procedures for\nreleasing and activating updates.\n\nWhere I disagree is that I do not believe that BIP8 with LOT configuration\nis the improved long term option we should ossify around either. I\nunderstand the triumvirate model you desire to achieve, but BIP8 with an\nindividually set LOT configuration does not formalize how economic nodes\nsend a network legible signal ahead of a chain split. A regular flag day,\nwith no signalling, but communally released and communicated openly most\nlikely better achieves the goal of providing users choice.\n\nWhere I also disagree is that we are likely to come to consensus on an\nimproved long term process in the immediate future (e.g., within the next\nyear), let alone the software for it.\n\nDo you believe that perfecting a release mechanism is a showstopping issue\nfor proceeding with any upgrade at this time? Or do you just want for this\nproblem to actively be worked on going forward?\n\nI think it's reasonable to want to form an open ended process to\ninvestigate, spec, and formalize a consistent and complete activation\npathway but I don't think we should force the community to wait around for\nan unknown solution to release upgrades that are waiting for takeoff.\n\n\nLastly, I'll make the case that ST *does* meet your desired triumvirate at\nleast as well as BIP8 with configurable LOT.\n\n1. Developers release, but do not activate\n2. Miners signal\n3. Users may override by compiling and releasing a patched Bitcoin with\nmoderate changes that activates Taproot at a later date. While this might\n*seem* more complicated a procedure than configurable LOT, here are four\nreasons why it may be simpler (and safer) to just do a fresh release:\n\nA. No time-based consensus sensitivity on when LOT must be set (e.g., what\nhappens if mid final signal period users decide to set LOT? Do all users\nset it at the same time? Or different times and end up causing nodes to ban\neach other for various reasons?)\nB. No \"missed window\" if users don't coordinate on setting LOT before the\nfinal period -- release whenever ready.\nC. ST fails fast, permitting users ample time to prepare an alternative\nrelease\nD. If miners continue to mine without signalling, and users abandon a\nLOT=true setting, their node will have already marked those blocks invalid\nand they will need to figure out how to re-validate the block.\n\nRE: point 3, is it as easy as it *could* be? No, but I don't have any\ngenius ideas on how to make it easier either. (Note that I've previously\nargued for adding configurable LOT=true on the basis that a user-run script\ncould emulate LOT without any software change as a harm reduction, but I\ndid not advocate that particular technique be formalized as a part of the\nactivation process)\n\n\nBest,\n\nJeremy\n\n\n> > > Taproot could be activated by a blind monkey, [...] ST avoids the\nhard questions, since it will almost certainly pass; [...] But one day, a\nreal crisis will return. We won't have an answer, and we won't have\npracticed: this will make the crisis far worse. Instead, if we codify \"devs\npropose, miners activate, users override\" (i.e. a LOT=true option, off by\ndefault) we'll know exactly what the process will be when miners fail to\nactivate. It may still be messy, of course, but we'll have all the tools at\nhand, and we'll even know the date the crisis will come to a head.\n> >\n> >\n> > I think this argument makes two major errors:\n> > ```\n> > * First, it tries to artificially tie two improvements together; \"if\nyou can't solve controversial activations, you shouldn't get taproot\". That\nisn't the way we should do development: just as it was a mistake to try to\ntie segwit and a hard-fork to double the block size together, other\nimprovements should also stand or fall on their own merits. If we're tying\nupdates together there should be good reasons for why they're better\ntogether (eg segwit and the witness discount; and taproot, schnorr and\ntapscript).\n> > ```\n>\n> No, this is a disagreement about how _all_ changes should be activated.\nThis is completely germane to the current debate. Remember, segwit wasn't\n\"controversial\" until it suddenly was, either. I believe this is not the\ncase here, but then, I believed that last time as well.\n>\n> > ```\n> > * Second, it assumes that you can usefully test a weapon when play\nfighting -- if taproot can be activated by a blind monkey, then having your\nbodyguards activate taproot only proves they're as good as a blind monkey,\nnot that they're ready to protect you from a home invasion. In particular,\nbip8 isn't even as ready as bip148 for a real battle; it lacks even the\nlimited safeguards that were included in that client (and it's also lost\nthe element of surprise, which might've been bip148's biggest advantage).\n> > ```\n>\n> \"BIP 8 isn't ready\" is definitely a factor, but while I prefer existing\ncode when there are no other major factors, there are IMHO major factors\nhere.\n>\n> > I think it also probably assumes that the bip8 approach is more ready\nto go than it is -- there are (IMHO) serious unresolved objections to bip8\nin every possible deployment mode (eg, just lot=true: developers are\nimposing decisions on miners and users; just lot=false: miners can object;\nlot=true and lot=false: unnecessary chain split risk, risk of downtime for\nthose running lot=true, risk of reorgs/wipeout for those running\nlot=false). Maybe all those objections -- even the ones from one of the\nbip8 authors -- are mistaken, but personally I think it's more likely that\nsignificant improvements are needed.\n>\n> \"unnecessary chainsplit risk\". No, that's exactly the point: if we end up\nwith various significant factions fighting over the rules, there will be a\nchainsplit. There are no technical workarounds for this. BIP 8 has been\nrevised to minimize the chance of an _unnecessary_ chainsplit, and the\nentire BIP-8 lot=true mechanism was designed as an explicit mining forcing\nfunction.\n>\n> I remember @pwuille saying explicitly about Segwit activation that users\nmust decide. That has stuck with me, and my preference for a hidden\nlot=true option reflects this understanding. Without such an option,\ndevelopers are saying \"you can override, but you'll have to replace us.\"\nThe result in practice that users are reduced to \"beg the devs\" or \"beg the\nminers\". That kinda worked last time but damn it was messy, and such\nuncertainty does not help the BItcoin ecosystem.\n>\n> > Personally, I can think of about half a dozen soft-forks I would\nlike/expect to see progress on once taproot is squared away (great\nconsensus cleanup, anyprevout, ctv, graftroot, annex-based block\ncommitments, op_cat/covenants), so it's not like there aren't other\nopportunities to improve activation methodologies coming up.\n>\n> If this approach is good enough until there's a crisis, then why would\nanyone approve anything until a crisis comes?\n\n--\n@JeremyRubin <https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n<https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20210325/5da65bbf/attachment-0001.html>"
