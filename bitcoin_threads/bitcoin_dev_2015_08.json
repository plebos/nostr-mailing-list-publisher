But it's not as clear cut\nfor the larger blocks case. They may move over gradually as they see the\nnew chain gain acceptance, demonstrated by the higher trading volume on it.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150801/21ee73b2/attachment.html>"

The blockchain provides utility at\nevery size, and perhaps more at some sizes than at other sizes, but any\nfinite size will permit some use cases and not others.

Blocks were not constantly full until recent months, and many \nminers are still keeping the 750kB soft limit. This strongly suggests \nthat we won't have 4MB blocks now even Satoshi set a 8MB limit.\n\nI don't have the data now but I believe the Satoshi Dice model failed \nnot primarily due to the 1MB cap, but the raise in BTC/USD rate. Since \nminting reward is a fixed value in BTC, the tx fee must also be valued \nin BTC as it is primarily for compensating the extra orphaning risk. As \nthe BTC/USD rate increases, the tx fee measured in USD would also \nincrease, making micro-payment (measured in USD) unsustainable.\n\nWe might have less full nodes, but it was Satoshi's original plan: \"At \nfirst, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows \nbeyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists \nwith server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need \nto have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with \nthat one node.\" Theoretically, we only require one honest full node to \nprove wrongdoing on the blockchain and tell every SPV nodes to blacklist \nthe invalid chain.\n\nI think SPV mining exists long before the 1MB block became full, and I \ndon't think we could stop this trend by artificially suppressing the \nblock size. Miners should just do it properly, e.g. stop mining until \nthe grandparent block is verified, which would make sure an invalid fork \nwon't grow beyond 2 blocks.\n\n\n\n>> Global bandwidth is expected to grow by 37%/year until 2021 so\n>> 27.67% should be safe at least for the coming 10 years.\n>> Source:\n>> \n> https://www.telegeography.com/research-services/global-bandwidth-forecast-service/\n\n> \n> I'd rather be conservative here.

I think we should at least restore the original \n32MB limit in a reasonable time frame, say 6-8 years, instead of 20 \nyears in your proposal. If you believe Bitcoin should become a global \nsettlement network, 32MB would be the very minimum as that is only 75% \nof current SWIFT traffic."

People are rightly concerned about any given\nregional or nation-state's dominance in mining, but China has\ncertainly become more of a subject of concern as of late, and not\nsimply because it is a communist country and because its economy is\nhighly centralized and state-run, but rather, because of the advent of\nnewly proposed or adopted laws (not unlike those which we see being\nproposed in the UK or those recently adopted in France, so that no-one\nmay say I am unfairly targeting China).  Further, the recent shots off\nthe bow between the USA and China in the latest crypto-wars saga\n(whether bluster or ultimately not) mean that we should be seriously\nconcerned about too much mining happening in one specific region; thus\nthere shouldn't be too much incentive for that to happen, yet at the\ntime being (as you've rightly pointed out) the subsidization of\nelectricity there, combined with the availability of certain\nenvironmental conditions for cooling and / or hydropower, means that\nChina dominates the mining realm.\n\nRecently I took the time to ask someone associated with a new bitcoin\nmining operation in China some questions about the new (apparently\ndeveloping) National Security Law of China.\n\nAccording to an early draft of this National Security Law, \"the State\nmaintains the basic economic system and order of the socialist\nmarketplace ... safeguarding security in important industries and\nfields that influence the populace's economic livelihood ... as well\nas other major economic interests.\"\n\nThe Chinese government is currently reviewing another national\nsecurity related law, which in its first draft would mandate ALL\nInternet companies operating in China to provide backdoor access and\nencryption keys to the government.  (One would imagine that would\ninclude any exchanges and mining operations as well.)\n\nThe US FBI Director (Comey) has also, of course, made plenty of\narguments for backdoors in encryption.  But as security expert Bruce\nSchneier points out, there \"really is no way\" to keep users' data safe\nwhile providing backdoors. He said:\n\n    \"I have two options. I can design a secure system that has no\nbackdoor access, meaning neither criminals nor foreign intelligence\nagencies nor domestic police can get at the data. Or I can design a\nsystem that has backdoor access, meaning they all can.\"\n(Reference:\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/because-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-secure-\nbackdoor-gosh-darn-it/\n)\n\nAnyway, the response of the individual (eric at haobtc - of haobtc.com)\nto my questions can be seen here:\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.msg11914077#msg11914077\n\nHis responses were provided to me before the recent \"Crypto Wars\"\nannouncements which I think will only think make things worse:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/helios_unbound/status/627648646985719809\n\nSo, I try to be optimistic, but I'm leaning pessimistic right now\nabout the situation with the effect of the Crypto Wars combined with\nthe dominance of Chinese mining plus China's development of new laws\nthat seem to involve further attempts to backdoor hardware and / or\nsoftware.  Obviously this doesn't break bitcoin for mathematical\nreasons that everyone on this list is already familiar with I'm sure,\nbut it is concerning to me, and now I will /endrant\n\nOn 08/02/2015 02:02 PM, Jim Phillips via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n> China is a communist country.

It does to me.\n\nIn a scenario where these network limitations and miner rate\ndistributions are the same to begin, and the block and transaction\nsize limits are raised or removed, your observation would seem to\nindicate that blocks that are outstandingly large would not be mined\noften or at all (due to orphan risk), until at least the network\nlimitations or rate distributions changed.\n\nSuch a scenario could shape up to be a non-event. Miner majority could\nchoose to not change their policy regarding effective block and\ntransaction sizes (which includes both the size of the blocks they\ncreate and the size of the blocks that they choose to build upon). To\nmake it not a total non-event, then the miners might update their\npolicy to increase the effective sizes a measured amount. They\nwouldn't want to go too far because of the risk of spooking the\neconomic majority, or because of their own technological limitations\n(which I'm supposing would remain transport layer limitations).\n\nTo me, in absence of these transport layer limitations that have crept\nup into the consensus rules layer (clear layer violations), it seems\nthat one thing that would otherwise naturally bound the upper and\nlower limits of effective block and transaction size is the economic\nmajority feedback loop to miners. Get too far out of line and the\neffect on usefulness, or properties of the system, will make people\nreact by lowering the purchasing power of the block rewards. For\nexample, attack other miners to drive more mining centralization, or\ncreate blocks that are currently too big for people to validate/use,\nand that feedback loop will start to direct negatively.\n\nWhy do miners not currently choose policy that favors smaller blocks\nand transactions than they do? Laziness/indifference only explains so\nmuch. I submit that they don't because if they make the system less\nuseful, then people will react by selling off coins and potentially\nleaving the ecosystem (they might also just wait on the sidelines to\nsee if the system self-corrects). If the miners tested those waters,\nand found out that they made a mistake, at least they would be free to\ncorrect their actions (and quickly). Not all would be lost. Some value\ncould be (temporarily) lost. It could also be re-gained if the system\nself-corrected.\n\nTo follow-up on the layer violation idea that I started on before, I\nthink a secondary, non-consensus rule layer, indication of what block\nand transaction sizes are acceptable to the economic majority would be\nfound in the transport protocols that they use. For example, the\neffective P2P protocol limit that is 2MB or 32MB (depending on version\nof the Core client) would be one such indication. Doesn't anyone think\nthat separating the consensus layer rules from the transport layer\nsupporting it should be a goal?\n\nOn Mon, Aug 3, 2015 at 2:34 AM, Adam Back via bitcoin-dev\n<bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> If block-sizes are increased in a way detrimental to the Chinese miners, it\n> is not the Chinese miners that lose, it is all of the non-Chinese miners -\n> this is because the Chinese miners have the slight majority of the hashrate.\n> The relatively low external bandwidth connecting China to the net is\n> actually the problem of the non-Chinese miners problem.

Have I just\nmissed it? By my count:\n\n - blocks in 25 btc in rewards and about 0.5 btc in fees per block\n - at ~$300 USD per btc, that's ~$7,650 per block\n\n - current hashrate is ~400 PH/s; so ~240,000 PH/block works out\n   to having to spend about 30PH per dollar earnt.\n - for comparison,\n      https://products.butterflylabs.com/cloud-mining-contracts.html\n    quotes $1.99 per GH/s for 12 months, which by my count is\n      60*60*24*365 / 1.99 GH/$ = 15.8 PH per dollar spent\n - hashrate growth has slowed from about x4/quarter to x2/year:\n     sep '13: ~1PH/s\n     dec '13: ~4PH/s\n     mar '14: ~20PH/s\n     jun '14: ~80PH/s\n     sep '14: ~200PH/s\n     aug '15: ~400PH/s\n\n - so, as far as I understand it, miners don't make absurd profits compared\n   to capital investment and running costs\n - presumably, then, miners will stop mining bitcoin if the revenue/block\n   drops significantly at some point\n - less miners means a lower hashrate; a lower hashrate makes\n   50% attacks easier, and that's a bad thing (especially if there's lots\n   of pre-loved ASIC mining hardware available cheap on ebay or alibaba)\n\n - in about a year, the block reward halves, cutting out 12.5 btc or\n   ~$3750 USD per block. without an increase in fees per block, miners\n   will just get ~$3900 USD per block\n - the last time the reward for mining a block was under $4000 per block\n   was around oct '13, with a hashrate of ~2PH/s\n\n - 13 btc in fees per block compared to .5 btc in fees per block is a\n   25x increase; which could be either an increase in fee/txn or\n   txns/block\n - with ~500 bytes/transaction, that's ~2000 transactions per MB\n - 13 btc in fees ($3900) per block means per transaction fees of\n   about\n     $2 for 1MB blocks\n     $1 for 2MB blocks\n     25c for 8MB blocks\n     10c for 20MB blocks\n   (assuming full blocks, 500 byte txns)\n\n - comparing that to credit card or paypal fees at ~2.5% that's:\n    $2 -> minimum transaction  $80\n    $1 -> minimum transaction  $40\n    25c -> minimum transaction $10\n    10c -> minimum transaction  $4\n\n - those numbers only depend on the USD/BTC exchange rate in so far as\n   the more USD for a BTC, the more likely the block reward will pay\n   for hashrate without transaction fees, even with the reward reduced\n   to 12.5 btc/block. otherwise it's just USD/txn paying for USD/hashrate\n\n - the reference implementation fee of 0.1mBTC/kB equates to about\n   3c per transaction (since it rounds up). Even 10c/transaction is more\n   than a 3x increase on that.\n\nWhat the above says to me is that even assuming everyone starts paying\nfees, the lightning network works great, and so do sidechains and whatever\nelse, you /still/ want to up the volume of bitcoin txns by something like\nan order of magnitude above what's currently allowed within a year or so.\n\nCheers,\naj"

Enough that they stop\nbeing irrational about free transactions. If both things happen,\nnon-urgent transaction fees will likely rise (as said, above zero).\n\nYou think that would be a catastrophe for adoption and I disagree.\nBut (as Pieter has repeatedly explained) for any size there will be\nuse cases that will be eventually priced out.\nSo when rising this consensus limit, not increasing centralization\nshould be the priority and the potential impact in market fees a much\nmore secondary concern.\nDo you agree with this?\n\nI'm sure there are many intermediate positions between \"caring more\nabout mining centralization than market fees when deciding about a\nconsensus rule that limits mining centralization\" and \"not caring\nabout mining centralization at all\".\nI really don't want to put words in your mouth, but I honestly don't\nknow what your position is.\nI don't really know how else can I ask the same question: you don't\ncare the consensus maximum blocksize rule being here at all or not\n(you just said that).\nIs it because you don't think it limits mining centralization or\nbecause you don't care about limiting mining centralization with\nconsensus rules at all?"

If we go by that then we'd soon be\ngiving coinbase rewards to users for being \"loyal supporters\" because,\nas a majority, they think that's what they'd like to see.\n\nIf a proposal is demonstrably, and provably, a good idea - and a\ndeveloper consensus agrees - then it should go to testing, and\neventually, code. Other than that it's just conjecture and words\nwithout a research paper and data.\n\nIn the final analysis, do we want Bitcoin to be steered by an\nuninformed and fickle majority, or do we want to use this list as a\nforum to present research proposals containing repeatable, verifiable\nfacts?

But that's much more difficult and if you just\nclaim it (and consequently advocate for the complete removal of the\nconsensus rule) we will have already advanced a lot.\nBut you denying that the limits serves limiting mining centralization\nand at the same time advocating for keeping a limit at all doesn't\nseem very consistent.\nIf you don't want that rule to limit mining centralization pressures,\nwhat do you want it for?"

Greg Maxwell posted on reddit a while back something to the effect\nof \"the big block advocates are overstating the urgency of the block size\nincrease, because if there was actually a situation that required us to\nincrease block size, we could make the increase when it was actually\nneeded.\" I found that somewhat persuasive, but I am concerned that I\nhaven't seen any discussion of what the \"let's wait for now\" camp would\nconsider a valid reason to increase block size in the short term, and how\nthey'd make the tradeoff with tx fees or whatever else was necessitating\nthe increase.\n\nJorge, if a fee equilibrium developed at 1MB of $5/tx, and you somehow knew\nwith certainty that increasing to 4MB would result in a 20 cent/tx\nequilibrium that would last for a year (otherwise fees would stay around $5\nfor that year), would you be in favor of an increase to 4MB?\n\nFor those familiar with the distinction between near/far mode thinking\npopularized by Robin Hanson: focusing on concrete examples like this\nencourages problem solving and consensus, and focusing on abstract\nprinciples (like decentralization vs. usability in general) leads to people\ntoward using argument to signal their alliances and reduce the status of\ntheir opponents. I think it'd be very helpful if more 1MB advocates\ndescribed what exactly would make them say \"OK, in this situation a block\nsize increase is needed, we should do one quickly!\", and also if\nGavin/Mike/Jeff described what hypothetical scenarios and/or test results\nwould make them want to stick with 1MB blocks for now.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150805/0913c1b2/attachment.html>"

Sadly I have no choice, the later\nis what we have right now. And reducing the block size can't guarantee\nthat the situation will get better or even that fees could rise to\n$5/tx (we just don't have that demand, not that it is a goal for\nanyone). All I know is that increasing the block size *could*\n(conditional, not necessarily, I don't know in which cases, I don't\nthink anybody does) make things even worse.\n\nOn the other hand, I could understand people getting worried if fees\nwhere as high as $5/tx or even 20 cent/tx but we're very far away from\nthat case. How can low subsidies (a certainty) be \"too far in the\nfuture to worry about it\" but $5/tx, 20 cent/tx or even 5 cent/tx an\nurgent concern? For all I know, 5 cent/tx may not happen in the next\n25 years: it may never happen. And if it happens, to me it will be a\nsymptom of Bitcoin success, even for others it means that Bitcoin has\nbecome a \"high value settlement network\".\nTo the question\n\n- At which minimum mining fee rate will you urge others to change the\nconsensus rules to increase the block size?\n\nI'm very sorry, but my answer is:\n\n- I honestly don't know, that may never happen.\n\nWhat I can tell you is this: I will never be worried about \"too high\nfees\" while the fees remain at 0 (null, zero, nothing, cero, nada,\nzilch).\nThat's right, no matter what wallet's defaults chose for their users,\nno matter what the minimum relay fee policy does to the \"fee market\"\nand how much urgent transactions pay in fees; the fact remains that in\npractice non-urgent transactions usually (when the raw transaction's\nstructure it's appropriate) don't have to pay fees.\n\nI'm still missing an answer from the \"big blocks size side\" to the\nfollowing question (which I have insistently repeated with various\npermutations):\n\nIf \"not now\" when will it be a good time to let fees rise above zero?\nAfter the next subsidy halving? After 4 more subsidy halvings (ie\nabout 13 years from now, subsidy = 1.5625 btc/block )? After your\ngrandmother abandons her national currency and uses Bitcoin for\neverything? Never?\n\nANY answer (maybe with the exception of the last one) would be less\nworrying than silence.\n\n> For those familiar with the distinction between near/far mode thinking\n> popularized by Robin Hanson: focusing on concrete examples like this\n> encourages problem solving and consensus, and focusing on abstract\n> principles (like decentralization vs. usability in general) leads to people\n> toward using argument to signal their alliances and reduce the status of\n> their opponents.\n\nI really appreciate your efforts to mediate in this dispute and I\nhonestly hope that my previous answer is useful as it is.\n\n> I think it'd be very helpful if more 1MB advocates\n> described what exactly would make them say \"OK, in this situation a block\n> size increase is needed, we should do one quickly!\", and also if\n> Gavin/Mike/Jeff described what hypothetical scenarios and/or test results\n> would make them want to stick with 1MB blocks for now.\n\nJust replace 1MB with ANY size.\nBut, yes, please, when will you consider a size to be too dangerous\nfor centralization?\nWhy 20 GB would have been safe but 21 GB wouldn't have been (or the\nrespective maximums and respective +1)?\n\nNote that \"Never, 20GB was just a number closer to infinity than 1MB\nand I hoped that could had been voluntarily accepted by users. What I\nreally want is to completely remove this consensus rule forever.\" is a\nperfectly valid answer. It just means that I will agree with people\nthat think this way as explained in [1] (yes, not even after\nsuperluminal communication).\n\nAs an less relevant note, I feel extremely uncomfortable about being\nincluded in the \"1MB advocates\" group. As I've tried to explain\nseveral times, 1 is to me an arbitrary number like any other (at most,\nthe canonical arbitrary number), and so it is 1000000\n(MAX_BLOCK_SIZE). I rarely like being grouped or labelled, but maybe\nsomething more accurate like \"not-recklessly-change-consensus-rules\nadvocates\" would help.\nThere's nothing special about 1MB apart from being the current rule,\nso I don't think the number is that much relevant to the discussion.\nGrouping anyone that has raised any concern about rising the consensus\nblock size limit as \"the 1MBers\" is about as fair as grouping anyone\nthat has ever proposed a rise in the maximum size as \"the 20GBers\"\n(specially when there's people that belong to both groups\nsimultaneously, like Pieter Wuille who started this thread, and whose\nproposal we're supposed to be discussing).\n\n[1] http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/009947.html"

It sounds like you think the risks are too great / uncertain to\nmove from 1 MB to 4 MB blocks in the situation I described. I'm not clear\nthough on which specific risks you'd be most worried about at 4 MB, and if\nthere are any risks that you think don't matter at 4 MB but that you would\nbe worried about at higher block size levels. I also don't know if we have\nsimilar ideas about the benefits of low tx fees. If we discussed exactly\nhow we were evaluating this scenario, maybe we'd discover that something I\nthought was a huge benefit of low tx fees is actually not that compelling,\nor maybe we'd discover that our entire disagreement boiled down to our\nestimate of one specific risk.\n\nFor the record, I think these are the main harms of $5 tx fees, along with\nthe main risks I see from moving to 4 MB:\n\nFees of $5/tx would:\n(a) Prevent a lot of people who could otherwise benefit from Bitcoin's\ndecentralization from having an opportunity to reap those benefits.\nEspecially people in poor countries with corrupt governments who could get\nimmediate benefit from it now.\n(b) Prevent developers from experimenting with new Bitcoin use-cases, which\nmight eventually lead to helpful services.\n(c) Prevent regular people from using Bitcoin and experimenting with it and\ngetting involved, because they think it's unusable for txns under many\nhundreds of dollars in value, so it doesn't interest them. Not having the\npublic on our side could make us more vulnerable to regulators.\n\nChanging the block size to 4 MB would:\n(1) Probably reduce the number of full nodes by around 5%. Most of the drop\nin full nodes over the past few years is probably due to Bitcoin Core being\nused by fewer regular users for convenience reasons, but the extra HD space\nrequired and extra bandwidth would probably make some existing people\nrunning full nodes stop.\n(2) Not hinder low bandwidth miners significantly, because of the relay\nnetwork.\n(3) Not introduce any tx verification issues, because processors are fast\nand tx processing is ridiculously cheap and we'd need way more than 4 MB of\ntxs for it to be a bottleneck.\n\nSo (1) is the only risk that gives me any significant concern, but I don't\nthink that the number of full nodes now is at a dangerous level.\n\nAnyway, the point isn't for you and I to actually discuss this particular\nhypothetical in more detail (although I would be curious to see similar\nlists from you). I haven't studied the risks enough to actually put this\nforth to the list as a good argument for what to do in this situation. My\nmain point is that being very specific and concrete both about our thought\nprocess and about the hypothetical situation results in much better\ndiscussions.\n\nThere's one more piece of information that I can give you which will help\nyou understand my position much better, and also force me to think really\ncarefully about this. It's the point at which I would switch to the other\nside of the argument (either by varying the tx fee, or the block size). If\ntx fees would only rise to 60 cents or lower if we stayed at 1 MB, then I\nwould be against a move to 4 MB. Or, keeping the hypothetical 1 MB fee at\n$5, I think moving to 12 MB or higher is the point at which I'd switch over\nto being a 1 MB advocate. Getting that same info from you tells me exactly\nhow you weigh the risks in a way that just listing the factors can't. In\nthis specific hypothetical scenario, what is the lowest block size increase\nthat you'd accept? It can be extremely low, like 1.01 MB. If you tell me\nthat you'd rather have $5 tx fees for the next year instead of changing the\nblock size to 1.01 MB, I would be really surprised.\n\nGavin is the only other person who I've seen who has defined at what block\nsize he'd switch to the other side (maybe not with a concrete number, but\nwith a rough range: the block size such that a normal person with a pretty\ngood connection couldn't run a full node).\n\n\n> On the other hand, I could understand people getting worried if fees\n> where as high as $5/tx or even 20 cent/tx but we're very far away from\n> that case. How can low subsidies (a certainty) be \"too far in the\n> future to worry about it\" but $5/tx, 20 cent/tx or even 5 cent/tx an\n> urgent concern?\n\n\nI would say that in this case we know high tx fees could happen very soon\nbecause there is a clear mechanism. Bitcoin just needs to become more\npopular quickly for any number of reasons. Suppose the infrastructure for\nremittances starts falling into place within the next two months, and\nsuddenly immigrants are clamoring to use Bitcoin to send money back to\ntheir home countries. This could result in $5 tx fees very soon (not that I\nthink it's likely). Many of these immigrants would still use Bitcoin\nbecause it's still better than the alternative for remittances, which would\nprice out a lot of people currently using Bitcoin for other reasons. As far\nas I know, there is no plausible way that subsidies could plummet in\nanywhere near that time frame, aside from the price of Bitcoin completely\ncollapsing. But if that happens in the near term (specifically, with very\nlow tx volume) a fee market won't help.\n\n\n> For all I know, 5 cent/tx may not happen in the next\n> 25 years: it may never happen.

I'm optimistic about Lightning to handle the\ncases where people need even cheaper txns.\n\n\n\n> I'm still missing an answer from the \"big blocks size side\" to the\n> following question (which I have insistently repeated with various\n> permutations):\n>\n> If \"not now\" when will it be a good time to let fees rise above zero?\n> After the next subsidy halving?

Never?\n>\n> ANY answer (maybe with the exception of the last one) would be less\n> worrying than silence.\n>\n\nBefore I answer, here's my reasoning about why we don't need to worry about\na fee market now:\n\nThere is nothing particularly special about a fee market in Bitcoin. We\nknow how markets work, and we have no reason to suspect a fee market in\nBitcoin will have any new properties of markets that we can't foresee. When\ndemand becomes higher, there will be some equilibrium level of fee that\npeople have to pay to give a certain probability of inclusion within a\ncertain number of blocks. There will likely be some level of fee where if\nyou don't pay it, your tx will never be confirmed.\n\nWe have seen something like this working at various points in Bitcoin's\nhistory. Look at the recent \"stress tests.\" To get your tx confirmed in a\nreasonable time frame, you had to bump your fee a little higher than the\ntxns from whoever was flooding the network. If you did, everything worked\nfine. If you didn't, your tx didn't confirm (until the test ended, maybe?).\nSo there's nothing complicated here. It doesn't require a decade long\npreparation to prove to ourselves that a fee market will work.\n\nUnless in the future mining is funded mostly by charity (I think there's\nonly a 25% chance of that happening), we will need a fee market eventually.\nI'd be fine if one developed now. I think 10 cents per txn right now\nwouldn't be too bad, aside from the following reason. What concerns me\nabout insisting on a fee market right now is that usage is so small and the\nblock size is so limited that if demand increases just a little bit, fees\ncould skyrocket. It's not the 10 cent fees that would worry me, but what\nthey say about the potential for a huge spike. Fees could become $10 per tx\nor higher very quickly. Yes, that would show that big organizations find\nBitcoin useful which is nice, but it'd also put decentralized money out of\nreach of many other people. While Bitcoin still has a lot of growth ahead\nof it, it's better to not set up roadblocks (for reasons other than\npreserving decentralization) in front of that growth which will make things\nvery painful if that growth happens more suddenly than we expect.\n\nI think the best argument for having a fee market right now is that if we\nmove to such a market suddenly in the future, wallets won't have time to\nmake the user experience good, and full nodes might not be written in such\na way that they gracefully handle a bunch of txns that might never confirm.\nI don't think the required software changes are that complex though, so it\nseems unnecessary to start adding friction for users now for something that\nmight be an issue in 10+ years.\n\nSo to answer your question: about two years before we think Bitcoin will\nneed to rely heavily on txn fees for security, I'd be in favor of adjusting\nblock size so that it resulted in enough total fees / security. Until that\npoint, we should care a lot about Bitcoin being widely used so that when we\ndo need a fee market, it's more like lots of people paying 5 cents per tx\ninstead of fewer people paying $10/tx. I think the former situation is much\nmore likely to sustainable, and we're more likely to get there if we\nencourage low fee use cases now.\n\nYou've been arguing that 0 fee transactions will have to disappear someday,\nbut this isn't necessarily true. As long as enough people care about having\ntheir txns confirm relatively quickly, there's no reason to make sure that\npeople who pay 0 fees never have their txns confirmed.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150806/6e7770c5/attachment-0001.html>"

I would just like that there was an attempt to automatically\nestimate those risks before taking those risks.\nSome function we're trying to optimize with simulations (based on\n#6382 ) to find an ideal (according to that imperfect metric) maximum\nconsensus block size.\nMaybe the function/simulations just take some minimum hardware\nspecifications and returns an block size, I don't know.\n\n> I agree that we don't have good data about what exactly a 4 MB increase\n> would do.

For all I know there could be a lot more full nodes being run\nthat for whatever reason are not seen by people collecting this data.\nThe block size maximum consensus rule limits mining centralization,\nnot just full node centralization. Gavin, for example, disagrees with\nthis.\nFortunately I believe at least 2 mathematical proofs can be produced\nto demonstrate Gavin and those who think like him are wrong.\n\n> (2) Not hinder low bandwidth miners significantly, because of the relay\n> network.\n\nI believe that even with the relay network, and even assuming all\nminers are connected using something like IBLT, a mathematical proof\ncan be constructed to demonstrate that bigger block sizes can prevent\nthe worse connected miners from being profitable.\nIt is important to note that the worse connected miners aren't\nnecessarily those with less bandwidth: maybe you have the best\nbandwidth but you are poorly connected to the majority of the hashrate\n(for example, because the majority of the hashrate is within the same\ncountry but that country is not very well connected to the rest of the\nworld).\n\n> (3) Not introduce any tx verification issues, because processors are fast\n> and tx processing is ridiculously cheap and we'd need way more than 4 MB of\n> txs for it to be a bottleneck.\n\nWe're certainly far away from this being a concern in practice.\nBut I'm working on a mathematical proof that at some scale CPU\nrequirements could become a discriminating factor making the smallest\nmining operations unprofitable.\n\n> So (1) is the only risk that gives me any significant concern, but I don't\n> think that the number of full nodes now is at a dangerous level.\n\nI don't think there's such a thing as a \"dangerous full node count level\".\nIt's just data that can be useful to build centralization metrics.\nProbably hashrate distribution by pool is much more interesting (and\nif you ask me that looks really bad right now without increasing the\nblock size consensus maximum).\n\n> Anyway, the point isn't for you and I to actually discuss this particular\n> hypothetical in more detail (although I would be curious to see similar\n> lists from you).

I don't think that minimum mining fees will rise above 1 usd\ncent/tx anytime soon even if we maintain the limit of 1MB.\nMaybe that's why I'm not worried at all about \"hitting the limit\".\nBut I'm sorry, I don't have those concrete numbers because it is a\ntrade-off I don't think we've studied in enough detail.\nWell, I can also say I wouldn't be worried at all about moving to,\nsay, 1.01 MB (because the difference in centralization pressure should\nbe minimal) and I would just take it as a \"let's proof hardforks are\npossible\" change similar to the one proposed in bip99.\n\n> Gavin is the only other person who I've seen who has defined at what block\n> size he'd switch to the other side (maybe not with a concrete number, but\n> with a rough range: the block size such that a normal person with a pretty\n> good connection couldn't run a full node).\n\nThat would be interesting to read and I have totally missed it.\nDo you have a link?\n\n> I would say that in this case we know high tx fees could happen very soon\n> because there is a clear mechanism.

Which of those occurs depends on how quickly and in what manner\nBitcoin gains popularity. Even if I thought there's an 95% chance that\nthere would be no sudden jump in Bitcoin tx demand, I would want to have\nsome rough plan in place for that other 5% when some previously difficult\nuse case becomes viable and demand spikes. Do those arguing for the \"wait\nand see\" approach not think that a quick increase in demand is even likely\nenough to warrant discussing what we'd do in that case? Greg Maxwell\nmentioned doubling the max block size if there was ever a standing backlog (\nhttp://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/007880.html\n-- I think fee level is a better metric than size of tx backlog), but I\nhaven't seen other devs comment on it.\n\n\n> But I'm sorry, I don't have those concrete numbers because it is a\n> trade-off I don't think we've studied in enough detail.\n>\n\nThe question is about what you'd do in the absence of those details that\nyou don't have. Imagine that fees spiked to $5/tx tomorrow. You have some\nmodel of the situation that allows you to say that 1.01 MB is something\nyou'd support, and that's the model that I'm trying to understand. The\nanswers I gave are not ones I'm confident about. I'm sure if I studied this\nfor a week they'd change. I sense that devs are reluctant to answer this\nquestion because it could be taken out of context or held against them\nlater. Or maybe they just don't like saying things that they don't have a\nhigh level of confidence about on principle. IMO this reluctance\ncontributes to a lack of understanding of each other's positions. We all\nhave these imperfect models in our heads that we're basing our\ndisagreements on, but we won't show each other these models.\n\n\n> > Gavin is the only other person who I've seen who has defined at what\n> block\n> > size he'd switch to the other side (maybe not with a concrete number, but\n> > with a rough range: the block size such that a normal person with a\n> pretty\n> > good connection couldn't run a full node).\n>\n> That would be interesting to read and I have totally missed it.\n> Do you have a link?\n\n\nSorry, I see how what I wrote was misleading. You've seen the email I'm\nreferring to. I was talking about when he defined the criteria he used\nqualitatively and suggested that's how he arrived at 20 MB:\nhttp://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/009971.html.\nI think he talks about it in a little more detail elsewhere. I inferred\nfrom that that he wouldn't support 40 MB or 80 MB, but that may be wrong.\n\nI should also have given credit to Pieter, as he even more explicitly\nspecified a level where he'd turn into a hard fork advocate, via his own\nhard fork proposal. Neither of these statements specifies exactly where the\nswitch-over point is, but they're the closest I've seen.\n\n\n> > I would say that in this case we know high tx fees could happen very soon\n> > because there is a clear mechanism.

Even if it\nhappened gradually -- suppose fees crept to 20 cents, then 50 cents, then\n75 over the next year -- I don't think I've ever seen a discussion of how\nthat should be handled, and what sort of fees people regard as high enough\nto justify considering a hard fork.\n\nI think it would prevent many people from supporting an urgent hard fork if\nthey knew how the core devs would handle that situation (assuming there was\nsome willingness to increase the block size if fees got too high).\n\n\n> > We have seen something like this working at various points in Bitcoin's\n> > history.

Then to pay for the same level of\nsecurity we have right now with only tx fees, assuming 1 MB blocks, the\naverage tx fee would have to be $3.50. Now suppose blocks are 100 MB in the\nfuture. The average tx fee is then only 3.5 cents. I think the former\nsituation will not actually work, and the only way that Bitcoin can survive\nis to eventually get into something more like the later situation. Let me\nknow if you want me to delve into why. I'll just note that even Lightning\ndoesn't work well when tx fees are that high, because channels need to be\nopened and closed pretty often and if my counterparty is uncooperative, his\nmaking me pay $3.50 starts to actually hurt.\n\nSo if we accept that, we need to end up in a situation where we eventually\nhave lots of people making on-blockchain txns, and paying relatively small\nfees. Encouraging lots of use and experimentation of Bitcoin between now\nand then seems pretty important for reaching that goal.\n\nWe're in a race with the block reward halving schedule, to see if we can\nget usage high enough to pay for security (while maintaining enough\ndecentralization) before all of the security burden falls on transactions.\nIf there aren't enough transactions at that time, the burden will be too\nhigh (or security will be too low) and people will find other solutions.\n\nWe seem to disagree about how hard it'll be to change wallet and node\nsoftware to cope with a fee market. As I've said I don't see very small\nnonzero fees (for instance one tenth of a cent) as a problem though. So if\na solution that traded off usage and decentralization in a way that I\nagreed with could be modified to ensure a fee market developed soon with\nvery low fees, I'd still support it.\n\n\n\n\n\n>\n> > Unless in the future mining is funded mostly by charity (I think there's\n> > only a 25% chance of that happening), we will need a fee market\n> eventually.\n> > I'd be fine if one developed now.

                "message_text_only": "The current block size debate has brought up an important, albeit often neglected observation. Full nodes suffer from a tragedy of the commons problem and therefore are likely to continue decreasing as a percentage of total Bitcoin nodes. This also results in a vicious circle as more and more people use SPVs, the burden on existing full nodes will increase even without a block size increase, which will further reduce the number of full nodes . A few people have mentioned it in blogs or reddit, but the topic is generally quickly overshadowed by posts along the lines of  \"RAISE the blocksize already!\".\nFull nodes bear the full cost of validating/relaying/storing the blockchain and servicing SPV clients but gain nothing financially from it, yet they serve an important role in validating transactions and keeping miner dishonesty in check. If there were few independent full nodes, it would be possible for 3-4 of the biggest mining pools to collude and do literally whatever they wanted with the protocol, including inflating the money supply, freezing funds or even confiscating funds, because who would know? And even if someone running a full node did voice out, the majority of users on SPV/Coinbase/etc.. would be powerless to do anything about it and would likely bear with the changes to protect status quo, just as is the case with current fiat regimes where people bear with QE/Inflation/bail outs because they are so dependent on the current system that they would rather tolerate any injustice than to have the system go down and bring them with it. This is the primary reason why many in the technical community are against drastic blocksize increases, as this will only worsen the problem of decentralization as this cost increases. And as long as full nodes are running on charity, i'm fully in agreement with the conservative block size camp. \nHowever, it is important to note that this seems to be an economic problem instead of a technical one.

It'd be interested to know who actually wrote it - \"Peter R\" is obviously a pseudonym and the paper goes into sufficient detail that it makes you wonder why the author didn't see the flaws in it.\n\nFor those wishing to do actual research, esp. people such as profs mentoring students, keep in mind that in Bitcoin situations where large miners have an advantage over small miners are security exploits, with severity proportional to the difference in profitability. A good example of the type of analysis required is the well known selfish mining paper, which shows how a miner adopting a \"selfish\" strategy has an advantage - more profit per unit hashing power - than miners who do not adopt that strategy, and additionally, that excess profits scales with increasing hashing power.\n\nAs for the OP, if this wasn't an attempt at misinformation, my apologies. But keep in mind that you're wading into a highly politically charged research field with billions hanging on the blocksize limit; understand that people aren't happy when flawed papers end up on reddit being used to promote bad ideas. You'd be wise to run future work past experts in the field prior to publishing widely if you dislike heated controversy.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\niQE9BAEBCAAnIBxQZXRlciBUb2RkIDxwZXRlQHBldGVydG9kZC5vcmc+BQJVwSwJ\nAAoJEMCF8hzn9Lnc47AH/RknSZpnZ8r4WA4r+S0yJmlo0hKm8gsjUGhaqX7cnuSR\ndB1ewrsjC4uPtSc8Ej1hzf37E67DTxiz6STq9XdtFSij+ww7SPx+z8yjEpQ0Ld0K\nOIidQ80WRGJ1UPMUt7pFDU3pxNZI/A46Lg3EmqjY+xAe6+wDlOHjT/miO3tv0uws\nnNYwrelA4f/KQXkUggGUOW62Sc3fJpUxLurq4eQHflIxtk3KM1reSxwG28KG02j6\nlTUEHmMsmE7qoQAl60vwfvVKvvy/RwxpildwNey6IgtCQqWqqEy+WoTsgyVAGIbn\n+8gR//W2hEIp+W5OSsiVNZ5S/KpcwaIBqZFcoca8838=\n=HJiv\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node\u2019s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the block space supply curve and the mempool demand curve.  The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk.  The latter represents the fees offered by the transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees.  The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner\u2019s profit.  The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market\u2014where miners are incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks\u2014cannot exist since it requires communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate.  The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.  \n>> \n>> Best regards,\n>> Peter\n>> _______________________________________________\n>> bitcoin-dev mailing list\n>> bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org\n>> https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev\n> \n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150805/cb541df0/attachment-0001.html>"

But at worst, the \ndiscussion can be considered to apply directly only to low-hashpower \nminers right now.\n\nOverall, the paper does not predict big changes to per/kb fees or spam \ncosts for the kinds of block sizes being discussed for the immediate \nfuture (8MB).  But it does conclude that these fees will rise, not fall, \nwith bigger blocks.\n\nAlso it is welcome that this paper actually mentions the bitcoin \nexchange rate as a factor in relation to block size (it points out that \na spam attack is much more expensive in fiat terms today than it was \nyears ago)."

Changing that dynamic by shifting influence\ncan have security and control impacting side-effects, and needs to be\nthought about carefully.\n\nAbout security to try to make those comparisons a bit more formal I\nposted this taxonomy of types of security that proposals could be\ncompared against, in order of security:\n\n1. consensus rule (your block is invalid if you attack)\n2. economic incentive alignment (you tend to lose money if you attack)\n3. overt (attack possible but detectable, hence probably less likely\nto happen for reputation or market signal reasons even if possible\nanonymously)\n4. meta incentive (assume people would not attack if they have an\ninvestment or interest in seeing Bitcoin continue to succeed)\n\nAdam"

                "message_text_only": "Thank you for the feedback, Benjamin.\n\n> When you talk about a market, what are you referring to exactly?\n\nI define what I mean by healthy, unhealthy, and non-existent markets in Section 7, and I show a figure to illustrate the supply and demand curves in each of these three cases.  A healthy market is defined as one where a rational miner would be incentivized to produce a finite block.  An unhealthy market is one where a miner would be incentivized to produce an arbitrarily large block.  A non-existant market is one where a miner is better off publishing an empty block.  I show that so long as block space in a normal economic commodity that obeys the Law of Demand, and that the Shannon-Hartley theorem applies to the communication of the block solutions between miners, that an unhealthy market is not possible.  \n\n>  A market means that demand and supply are matched continuously, and Bitcoin has no such mechanism.\n\nTake a look at my definitions for the mempool demand curve (Sec 4) and the block space supply curve (Sec 5).  I show that the miner's profit is a maximum at the point where the derivatives of these two curves intersect.  I think of this as when \"demand and supply are matched.\"\n\n> ...I don't think a fee market exists and that demand or supply are not easily definable.\n\nDo you not find the definitions presented in the paper for these curves useful?  The mempool demand curve represents the empirical demand measureable from a miner\u2019s mempool, while the block space supply curve represents the additional cost to create a block of size Q by accounting for orphaning risk.  \n\n> Ideally supply of transaction capability would completely depend on demand, and a price would exist such that demand can react to longterm or shorterm supply constraints.\n\nSupply and demand do react.  For example, if the cost to produce block space decreases (e.g., due to improvements in network interconnectivity) then a miner will be able to profitably include a greater number of transactions in his block.  \n\nFurthermore, not only is there a minimum fee density below which no rational miner should include any transactions as Gavin observed, but the required fee density for inclusion also naturally increases if demand for space within a block is elevated.  A rational miner will not necessarily include all fee-paying transactions, as urgent higher-paying transactions bump lower-fee transactions out, thereby bidding up the minimum fee density exponentially with demand.\n\n> In such a scenario there would be no scalability concerns, as scale would be almost perfectly elastic.\n\nAgreed.  \n\nBest regards,\nPeter\n\n> \n> On Tue, Aug 4, 2015 at 8:40 AM, Peter R via bitcoin-dev <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> Dear Bitcoin-Dev Mailing list,\n> \n> I\u2019d like to share a research paper I\u2019ve recently completed titled \u201cA Transaction Fee Market Exists Without a Block Size Limit.\u201d  In addition to presenting some useful charts such as the cost to produce large spam blocks, I think the paper convincingly demonstrates that, due to the orphaning cost, a block size limit is not necessary to ensure a functioning fee market.  \n> \n> The paper does not argue that a block size limit is unnecessary in general, and in fact brings up questions related to mining cartels and the size of the UTXO set.   \n> \n> It can be downloaded in PDF format here:\n> \n> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf\n> \n> Or viewed with a web-browser here:\n> \n> https://www.scribd.com/doc/273443462/A-Transaction-Fee-Market-Exists-Without-a-Block-Size-Limit\n> \n> Abstract.  This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node\u2019s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the block space supply curve and the mempool demand curve.  The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk.  The latter represents the fees offered by the transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees.  The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner\u2019s profit.  The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market\u2014where miners are incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks\u2014cannot exist since it requires communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate.  The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.  \n> \n> Best regards,\n> Peter\n> \n> _______________________________________________\n> bitcoin-dev mailing list\n> bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org\n> https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev\n> \n> \n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150805/cc0cf429/attachment-0001.html>"

They must first go through the \nusual peer review process and get approved by the developers in a \ntechnical standpoint, without political or philosophical considerations. \nAny fine tune of a candidate proposal may not become an independent \ncandidate, unless it introduces some \u201creal\u201d difference. \u201cNo change\u201d is \nalso one of the voting options.\n---------------------------------\nVoter groups\n\nThere will be several voter groups and their votes will be counted \nindependently. (The time frames mentioned below are just for example.)\n\nMiners: miners of blocks with timestamp between 1 to 30 Sept 2015 are \neligible to vote. One block one vote. Miners will cast their votes by \nsigning with the bitcoin address in coinbase. If there are multiple \ncoinbase outputs, the vote is discounted by output value / total \ncoinbase output value.\nMany well-known pools are reusing addresses and they may not need to \ndigitally sign their votes. In case there is any dispute, the digitally \nsigned vote will be counted.\n\nBitcoin holders: People with bitcoin in the UTXO at block 372500 (around \nearly September) are eligible to vote. The total \u201cbalance\u201d of each \nscriptPubKey is calculated and this is the weight of the vote. People \nwill cast their votes by digital signature.\nSpecial output types:\nMulti-sig: vote must be signed according to the setting of the \nmulti-sig.\nP2SH: the serialized script must be provided\nPublicly known private key: not eligible to vote\nNon-standard script according to latest Bitcoin Core rules: not eligible \nto vote in general. May be judged case-by-case\n\nDevelopers: People with certain amount of contribution in the past year \nin Bitcoin Core or other open sources wallet / alternative \nimplementations. One person one vote.\n\nExchanges: Centralized exchanges listed on Coindesk Bitcoin Index, \nWinkdex, or NYSE Bitcoin index, with 30 days volume >100,000BTC are \ninvited. This includes Bitfinex, BTC China, BitStamp, BTC-E, itBit, \nOKCoin, Huobi, Coinbase. Exchanges operated for at least 1 year with \n100,000BTC 30-day volume may also apply to be a voter in this category. \nOne exchange one vote.\n\nMerchants and service providers: This category includes all bitcoin \naccepting business that is not centralized fiat-currency exchange, e.g. \nvirtual or physical stores, gambling sites, online wallet service, \npayment processors like Bitpay, decentralized exchange like \nLocalbitcoin, ETF operators like Secondmarket Bitcoin Investment Trust. \nThey must directly process bitcoin without relying on third party. They \nshould process at least 100BTC in the last 30-days. One merchant one \nvote.\n\nFull nodes operators: People operating full nodes for at least 168 hours \n(1 week) in July 2015 are eligible to vote, determined by the log of \nBitnodes. Time is set in the past to avoid manipulation. One IP address \none vote. Vote must be sent from the node\u2019s IP address.\n\n--------------------\nVoting system\n\nSingle transferable vote is applied. \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote). Voters are \nrequired to rank their preference with \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, etc, or use \u201cN\u201d to \nindicate rejection of a candidate.\nVote counting starts with every voter\u2019s first choice. The candidate with \nfewest votes is eliminated and those votes are transferred according to \ntheir second choice. This process repeats until only one candidate is \nleft, which is the most popular candidate. The result is presented as \nthe approval rate: final votes for the most popular candidate / all \nvalid votes\n\nAfter the most popular candidate is determined, the whole counting \nprocess is repeated by eliminating this candidate, which will find the \napproval rate for the second most popular candidate. The process repeats \nuntil all proposals are ranked with the approval rate calculated.\n\n--------------------\nInterpretation of results:\n\nIt is possible that a candidate with lower ranking to have higher \napproval rate. However, ranking is more important than the approval \nrate, unless the difference in approval rate is really huge. 90% support \nwould be excellent; 70% is good; 50% is marginal; <50% is failed.\n\n--------------------\nTechnical issues:\n\nVoting by the miners, developers, exchanges, and merchants are probably \nthe easiest. We need a trusted person to verify the voters\u2019 identity by \nemail, website, or digital signature. The trusted person will collect \nvotes and publish the named votes so anyone could verify the results.\n\nFor full nodes, we need a trusted person to setup a website as an \ninterface to vote. The votes with IP address will be published.\n\nFor bitcoin holders, the workload could be very high and we may need \nsome automatic system to collect and count the votes. If people are \nworrying about reduced security due to exposed raw public key, they \nshould move their bitcoin to a new address before voting.\n\nDouble voting: people are generally not allowed to change their mind \nafter voting, especially for anonymous voters like bitcoin holders and \nsolo miners. A double voting attempt from these classes will invalidate \nall related votes.\n\nMultiple identity: People may have multiple roles in the Bitcoin \necology. I believe they should be allowed to vote in all applicable \ncategories since they are contributing more than other people."

If voters are\nhonest, it allows a middle ground to be reached.\n\nIf everyone votes strategically, it becomes approval voting.  With\nconsensus, there is an assumption that a significant fraction of the\ncommunity would be willing to be honest rather than strategic.\n\nThe outcome is possible a final decision but not a binding decision.\nVoters need to recognise that failing to find a middle ground could mean\nthey get their way but they split the community.\n\nAdditionally, since the point is to determine parameters, you don't\nnecessarily need to select from discrete candidates.\n\n- Initial new size\n- Rate of increase\n- Maximum size\n\nThey are just numbers.  You could have votes indicate what they want, and\nthen use the median as the consensus option.\n\nThe exception is to have the miners choose what the size is (subject to\nlimits).  That option is already entirely in the hands of the miners and\nthey could do it unilaterally.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150804/f82d581b/attachment.html>"

                "message_text_only": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nHello,\n\nIf I understand this correctly, Lightning only requires transaction\nmalleability to be fixed to be able to work ~ I believe that was going\nto happen in a release of (bitcoind), but I'm not sure if that is\ncorrect on timing ( note also, this wiki seems to be out of date on\ninfos about bitcoind https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoind )\n\nI have also heard it said that bitcoin should support relative\nlocktime opcodes so that long-lived micropayment channels would be\nable to be created, such that there would be Lightning functionality\nbeyond the basic microhop channels (which would be short-lived in\nnature at the basic level).\n\nThis would be nice, but it seems like such discussions would take a\nwhile to get done as basic development issues right now aren't even\nwrapping up (e.g. blocksize debate related stuff.)  Note that I've\nbeen in favor of going ahead with Cameron Garnham's dynamic softfork\nproposal right now, which can be seen at http://is.gd/DiFuRr - testing\nit out, seeing how that works, and at the same time making\npreparations for moving forward with Garzik's BIP 100 (which could be\ntailored or refined based on additional data gathered, without being\nturned into a controversial fork (e.g. needs to make sure to avoid\ninclusion of XT, for example).  Garnham's proposal and Garzik's\nproposal are not mutually exclusive, imho, and I don't see why the\nmatter can't simply be resolved, it seems to be just an endless pile\nof argumentation that will go on forever and ever.  This needs to,\nlike, stop.\n\nAlso, it strikes me that unless and until certain changes can be made\nin bitcoin that would reduce fees and cost to transact, solutions such\nas Lightning are going to fill the gap whether or not you want them\nto; users have a choice in the market, and as the billions of unbanked\nare gradually excluded from straight bitcoin, people will seek other\nservices which offer them lesser fees to transact, or they will seek\nother coins which offer them lesser cost to transact.  It is, after\nall, an open market.  I have made this point before elsewhere albeit\nwith more emphasis (and data to back up my point):\n( On Github at Pull Request #6201: http://is.gd/8bW0zq )\n\nIn making and successfully defending such points on Github, the\nfollowing conclusions were drawn:\nAs the cost to transact goes higher and higher based on this\nobservable trend (due to all the factors mentioned in the thread on\ngithub), then people who are affected by these rising costs to\ntransact will do one of three things with respect to bitcoin (and\nvirtual currencies generally):\n1) Ignore bitcoin (an unlikely possibility, but it is one that would\noccur),\n2) adopt alts which are more inclined to allow people to perform\nmicrotransactions,\n3) and/or use bitcoin increasingly off-chain, which is likely to come\nwith its own set of problems for the network.\n\nRegarding donation or microdonation use cases, To keep it all\non-chain, wallets can be designed to accumulate donation micro-amounts\naccording to donation settings of a user (in voluntary donation use\ncases such as in ABIS -- http://abis.io ) as an internal accounting\nfeature, for example, and when enough donation value is accumulated,\nit can be sent to the recipient by piggybacking on one of the user's\ndaily transactions.  This is one method doing so in a manner which is\non-chain; depending on the cryptocurrency under consideration, the\nfeasibility of doing this in a wallet will be greater or lesser.\n\n- -O\n\n\nOn 08/09/2015 01:14 PM, Hector Chu via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n> In the Lightning network it is assumed that the balances can always\n> be settled on the blockchain if any of the parties along the\n> channel has a problem.

Dialog pops up on phone:\n     \"Pay Infinitea $5.20? [yes] [no]\"\n\n 3. User presses [yes]\n\n 4. Brief pause\n\n 5. \"Payment confirmed\" appears on both user's phone and merchant's POS\n    device\n\nThe backend bits that need to happen:\n\n 1. Merchant passes on their identity and public key, an amount, and a\n    hash for the payment.\n\n 2. User's phone goes online to see if a route to the vendor can be\n    worked out, and to work out what lightning network fees are needed.\n    Also translates the bitcoins requested into the user's preferred\n    currency so they don't have to do maths in their head.\n\n 3. User's phone prepares a lightning transaction to the vendor, signed\n    with the corresponding lightning channel keys, using the hash the\n    merchant provided, and sends it through one of the channels the user\n    already has open and funded (at >$5.20 worth of bitcoins).\n\n 4. The transaction makes its way through the lightning network, and the\n    confirmation makes its way back. It's not clear to me how long this\n    realistically takes (either how many hops are likely, or how long\n    a single hop will actually take; I assume it should be a couple\n    of seconds).\n\n 5. UIs at both ends update. User gets a nice cup of tea.\n\nThere's a few potential problems with this:\n\n - what if the merchant says \"no you didn't pay me, your phone is lying,\n   you're a liar, I hate you, no tea for you\" despite your phone saying\n   you paid?\n\n     a) you could mitigate this by having the payments be incremental\n        (here's 1c, 520 times) with both terminals visibly updating;\n        but that would take up to 520x longer than sending a single\n        transaction, and mightn't really be any better anyway\n\n     b) you could also have the initial negotiation involve signing\n        something that could be adjudicated independently later (hey,\n        here's a QR code saying he owed me a tea, here's a QR code showing\n        I paid for it, and here's a video of him saying \"no tea for you\").\n\n     c) Or maybe you just bite the $5 and never shop there again; just\n        as you would if you handed over $5.20 in cash and then they told\n        you you hadn't paid them.\n\n - what if the transaction's unroutable? then you get a \"service\n   unavailable\" notice on your phone and pay by other means -- blockchain,\n   cash, etc. Same as if your credit card won't register. ditto if your\n   phone can't get on the internet.\n\n - what if the fees are large? (eg, the coffee costs $5, and the fees are\n   20c?)\n\n     a) I think they'll actually be small -- even for a 10% pa interest\n        rate denominated in bitcoin, the time-value of $5.20 in bitcoin\n        for 7 days is just under 1c (.35%). If so, that's noise, and the\n        user legitimately doesn't care. OTOH, it does get multiplied by\n        number of hops, and maybe the user cares about $5.20 vs $5.26.\n\n     b) Alternatively, the app could just indicate the fees (\"Pay $5.20 +\n        <1c in fees\") and/or the user could have an explicit setting for\n        fee info (\"Only warn me when fees are greater than either 5c/1%\")\n\n     c) Or you could have some UI magic, so the vendor's POS device\n        initially says \"advertised price is $5.20, but I actually\n        expect just $5.05, call the rest a discount\", the phone says\n        \"fees are 5c, so I'll display \"Pay just $5.10 for a $5.20 cup of\n        coffee!\". That's closer to how Visa/Mastercard do it and might\n        be reasonable in many cases.\n\n - what happens if the user presses \"yes\" but the lightning transaction\n   then fails? you don't want to wait for the 7 day timeout to know if\n   you can have a cup of tea; and you don't want the payment to go through\n   after you've paid for your tea in cash, drank it, and gone home.\n\n     a) Maybe the lightning network hubs just reply early cancelling the\n        transactions, and your phone can say \"failed\". You can't force\n        them to do this, but maybe the incentives work out okay so that\n        they'll want to anyway. (I think they will) If so, everything's\n        fine. As far as the merchant's concerned, you may as well have\n        just pressed \"No\".\n\n     b) The vendor could issue a conditional refund, eg an on-blockchain\n        transaction for the amount of the coffee from them to you,\n        payable if you ever receive the hash token. (And if you don't,\n        redeemable by them after a timeout). That doesn't work real well\n        if the fee for a blockchain txn is more than the price of a cup\n        of tea of course.\n\n> Assume neither the customer nor the tea shop are technically sophisticated\n> -- assume the customer is using an SPV wallet and the tea shop is using a\n> service similar to Bitpay.\n\nIMHO, most of the complexity isn't in doing the transaction, it's in\nmaintaining the channels. For example:\n\n - what if the tea shop has a sudden run of customers, and all their\n   payment channels fill up?\n\n - how do you close the till at the end of the day (ie, put your\n   earnings into a cold wallet so they can't be hacked as easily and\n   clear your channel so you can accept more payments tomorrow?) Do you\n   do this on the blockchain or do you have a different lightning\n   network channel to your \"bank account\"?\n\n - inversely; if you do all your weekly shopping and impulse buys (tea,\n   coffee, beer, meals, groceries, fuel, road tolls, ...) on lightning,\n   how do you reset your channels once a day/week/fortnight/month with\n   some money from your salary/savings, so they don't run out?\n\n - do refunds work, even after the original txn has finished? (\"Oh,\n   actually we're out of tea\")\n\n - you have to watch the blockchain once a week or so in case your\n   counterparty tries stealing your balance by replaying old states and\n   hoping you don't notice\n\n - how do you keep the channel keys/secrets sufficiently available\n   and secure?\n\n - how do you figure out who to make channels with in the first place,\n   and if/when to change them?\n\n - what happens if your phone breaks, is stolen or gets lost; have you\n   lost your channel secrets, and potentially all the coins in your\n   balance?\n\n - etc.\n\n(I don't think they're unsolvable or anything, though)\n\nCheers,\naj"

They have to setup a channel with someone first, and\nto do that, they'll need a \"sufficiently confirmed\" anchor transaction,\nand I don't think zero confirmations would be enough for that.\n\nSo:\n\n -1 \"Oh, how did that guy pay for tea with his phone? That's cool!\"\n    \"Scan the QR code, yeah, where the lightning logo is\"\n    \"Cool, I'll try it tomorrow\"\n\n 0 go home, \"open a lightning channel\", sleep, look forward to getting\n   tea tomorrow\n\nFor step 0, I guess it's:\n\n 0.1 \"Choose a hub to connect to\" (could be randomly selected)\n 0.2 \"Choose an amount to fund the channel\" (0.5 btc would be a lot)\n 0.3 \"Are you sure?\"\n 0.4 [wait briefly while counterparty signs]\n 0.5 [wait for 10 confirmations?]\n\nI don't think it's at all clear how 0.1 works in practice yet -- routing\nhas barely been spitballed, and without knowing how routing works, it's\nhard to say who to connect to.\n\nHard to say how much to put in in step 0.2 too -- if it takes a while to\nrefresh funds in a channel (you have to do a blockchain txn eg), then\nthat you should put more in; if you have multiple channels for whatever\nreason, maybe you can put less in each.\n\nThe \"Are you sure?\" might require some legal T&Cs in practice.\n\nYou need to have some realtime communication with your channel\ncounterpary when creating the anchor; but that should be fairly quick.\nYou also need to establish some random numbers and keys, but those could\nbe done in advance.\n\nI think you (or your counterparty) will want to wait for a few\nconfirmations before your channel is actually usable. So I think it'll\ntake over an hour for a channel to be \"open\" in even the best case.\n\nCheers,\naj"

It should be\nrelatively cheap if you game it out, though (I don't forsee me opening a\n1 BTC channel and being able to make $5 per month...)\n\n1-day is used as a convenience. However, the time between hops should be\nsomewhat long, as the intermediate steps can be extended further when\nyou want to offload the HTLCs to others who have a channel open with\nboth counterparties. E.g. Alice sends a payment to Dave through Bob and\nCarol. Bob has a channel with Carol and has an HTLC with it, but that\nchannel seems to be used a lot. Erin has a relationship to both Bob and\nCarol, she can offload the payment so that the payment actually goes to\nA->B->E->C->D.

It should be no different. If your wallet can't send\nfunds below the IsStandard value on-chain today, then I don't think it\nshould be able to to in the future, right? If you send funds *at* the\nminimum IsStandard value today, you're probably paying really high fees,\nthis is a problem that exists today.\n\n-- \nJoseph Poon"

My understanding is that the bitcoin relay network is\na backbone of connected high speed servers to increase the rate at which\ntransactions and new blocks propagate - and remove a number of delays in\nprocessing. But it would still require the miners to download the entire\nblock before building on top of it with any degree of confidence. With a\ntweak to only send the required information for other miners to build on\ntop of that block, this is a step towards what we propose, yet would\nrequire trust that the header information sent is accurate. The bitcoin\nrelay network website states that blocks are not fully verified and should\nbe checked by the miners before building on top of them.\n\nWhat we propose is more complex (granted!), yet that complexity serves a\npurpose. We reduce (and hopefully eliminate) the adverse incentive to\nentice miners to build on inaccurate data. This is achieved by making the\nfinancial losses of fake messages outweigh the financial gains of such\nattack vectors. It could also help in the block size debate if this\nproposed solution would eliminate the disadvantages of large blocks.\n\nOn Wed, Aug 5, 2015 at 1:27 PM, Matt Corallo <lf-lists at mattcorallo.com>\nwrote:\n\n> See-also: Bitcoinrelaynetwork.org.

                "message_text_only": "There is a common meme that block propagation times is the only metric\nthat matters when it comes to value the block size maximum consensus\nrule's usefulness in limiting mining centralization.\nHere is an extremely optimist thought experiment for those who think\nthat is the case:\n\nImagine that superluminal communication has somehow been invented and\nvalidity of mined blocks can be checked in constant time thanks to\nsome sort of snarks magic. This doesn't mean that block propagation is\nO(1) with respect to time because each node needs to repeat that cheap\nvalidation before relaying the block.\nStill, this is the best situation we can imagine with respect to block\npropagation, right?\nNo, wait, due to some technical or economical miracle this\nsuperluminal communication is free for everyone:\nbetter-than-physically-possible (our understanding of physics changes\nwith time as well, right?) communication and infinite bandwidth for\neveryone.\n\nAt this point, does the consensus block size maximum still help\nlimiting mining centralization or we can just remove it entirely?\nThe answer is yes, it can help limit mining centralization.\n\nLet's imagine that these amazing advancements have happened in less\nthan 22 years and we only had 6 more subsidy halvings, that's only 7\nhalvings in total, so the subsidy is still as high as 50 * (0.5 ^ 7) =\n0.390625 btc/block\n\nAlthough the orphan-block-probability cost for a miner to include an\nextra transaction has been completely minimized, it is still not null.\nLet's assume that while all these technical miracles were\nhappening...that 22 more years was enough for miners to realize this\nfact, they have removed the special-cased-for-free-transaction policy\ncode that currently comes with Bitcoin Core (or it has been removed\nfrom Bitcoin Core) and they don't mine transactions with fees lower\nthan 1 satoshi anymore.\n<sarcasm>I hope this last assumption doesn't turn out to be more wild\nthan superluminal communication...</sarcasm>\n\nBut there must be a physical limit: in our example, miners will have\ndifferent CPU constraints (to further simplify, genetically-engineered\nand super-fast memory also grows in the streets everywhere after an\naccident in a Monsanto Lab; or better downloadmoreram.com actually\nworks and I just hadn't tried from windows or mac).\n\nMiner A is able to process 100 M tx/block while miner B is only able\nto process 10 M tx/block.\n\nWill miner B be able to maintain itself competitive against miner B?\n\nThe answer is: it depends on the consensus maximum block size.\nHow so? Let's imagine that it has been completely removed.\n\nAssuming a fee of 1 satoshi per transaction and no shortage of\nunconfirmed transactions, miner A's block reward will be 0.390625 + 1\n= 1.390625 btc vs miner B's 0.390625 + 0.1 = 0.390625 + 0.1 = 0.490625\nbtc.\n\nDifficulty will tend to increase until the cost to produce a block\n(including interest in all the capital needed, paid or not) is equal\nto 1.390625 btc and therefore miner B will stop mining or go bankrupt.\nBut maybe 100 M and 10 M were too high numbers. What about 10 M and 1\nM? Still, 0.400625 btc can't compete with 0.490625 btc.\nYou think 10x is too much of a difference? Fine, 2M vs 1M: still\n0.400625 btc can't compete with 0.410625 btc\n\nIn summary, there will always be some physical limitation that may\nbenefit big mining players, so the block size maximum will always be\nuseful to limit mining centralization.\nIn other words (and I don't intend this to sound rude), if you want to\neventually remove the block size maximum consensus rule entirely, I\nwill never be able to agree with you: not even in your wildest dreams."

When you pay someone using its\nmain selling point, which is removing the need for physical presence, you\nare trusting that person.  Bitcoin doesn't obviate trust.  It obviates\nauthority.  Centralization of trust is what creates the authority that we\nall recognize as bad for our species.  It does this by making the\nauthority's use of coercion acceptable.\n\nBitcoin removes the need for authority, not trust.  It replaces trust in a\nsingle body with trust in a majority.  We want that majority to be healthy\nand varied (as opposed to largely co-opted by some authority). The\nreplacement has two effects.  1) It is very difficult for any single body\nto become the (coercive) authority that everyone has to trust (like central\nbanks). 2) It is very easy for a person to find a different single body to\ntrust if they don't like the one they are trusting now - or even stop\ntrusting one body and trust the majority instead, relying on #1 for\nprotection, and taking on the responsibility of running a full node.\n\nThe philosophical foundation of a thing is ultimately the basis of its\nvalue, so I thought it useful to point out the distinction between\nauthority and trust in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Stating that we will definitely hit the blocksize limit again\n      in the future is pure speculation about future bitcoin transaction volume\n      that can't possibly be known at this time, and is nothing but conjecture.\n      If technology increases faster than bitcoin transaction volume, simply\n      scaling the Bitcoin blocksize could keep up with future demand.\nIf Bitcoin\n      is successful beyond our wildest dreams and future transaction volume\n      outstrips future blockchain space, alternative solutions like\nsidechains or\n      the lightning network will have more time to be implemented.\n\n\n   1.\n\n   The full node count will go down if we increase the blocksize because it\n   will be more costly to run a full node.\n\n\n   -\n\n      I'm not sure this is true. I currently run a full node on a higher\n      end consumer PC with a higher end home network connection, but if the\n      blocksize limit is not raised and transaction fees increase such\nthat it is\n      no longer economical for me to access the bitcoin blockchain directly, I\n      will no longer run a full node to support the network. Bitcoin\nis no longer\n      interesting to me if it gets to the point where the average user\nis priced\n      off the blockchain. Users that have direct access to the blockchain are\n      more likely to run full nodes. If Bitcoin ever becomes purely a limited,\n      small settlement network, I will no longer support it and move onto\n      something else.\n\n\n   1.\n\n   The blocksize can only be increased if there is developer \u201cconsensus\u201d\n   and the change is not \u201ccontroversial\u201d.\n\n\n   -\n\n      Any blocksize increase will the deemed \u201ccontroversial\u201d and lack\n      \u201cconsensus\u201d, but doing nothing in the face of consistently full\nblocks and\n      rising transaction fees is also \u201ccontroversial\u201d and will lack\n\u201cconsensus\u201d.\n      Inaction, maintaining the status quo, and blocking a blocksize\nincrease in\n      the face of consistently full blocks and rising transaction fees\nis just as\n      controversial as increasing the blocksize.\n\n\n   1.\n\n   Don't increase the blocksize now with all the promising work going on\n   with sidechains and the lightning network.\n\n\n   -\n\n      KISS (keep it simple, stupid). When dealing with a highly complex,\n      mission critical system, there needs to be a very compelling reason to\n      choose a much more complex solution over a simple solution like BIP101.\n      Sidechains and the lightning network are much more complex than\nBIP101 and\n      introduce new points of failure. It's hard enough to get folks\nto trust the\n      Bitcoin network after 7 years, so it will likely take years until\n      sidechains and the lightning network are proven enough to be trusted by\n      users.\n\n\n   1.\n\n   Some miners will be at a disadvantage with larger blocks.\n\n\n   -\n\n      As folks have pointed out multiple times, network speed is just one\n      of many variables that impact mining profitability. I don't believe for a\n      second that every miner in China (57% of the network) would be negatively\n      impacted by larger blocks because some of them either have decent network\n      connections or connect to mining pools with decent network connections.\n      Miners will be given ample notice of a blocksize increase before\nit occurs,\n      so they will have time to make plans to deal with larger blocks. More\n      transactions per block should also increase miner profitability because\n      more transactions equals more users equals more transaction fees!\n\nIn conclusion, I think the next year is a make or break year for Bitcoin\nand hope the developers do everything they can to come up with a reasonable\nlong term growth plan to put Bitcoin in the best possible position to be\nsuccessful.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150806/3c575c43/attachment.html>"

                "message_text_only": "Bitcoin is built on game theory. Somehow we seem to have forgotten that and\nare trying to fix our \"block size issue\" with magic numbers, projected\npercentage growth of bandwidth speeds, time limits, etc... There are\ninstances where these types of solutions make sense, but this doesn't\nappear to be one of them. Lets return to game theory.\n\nProposal: Allow any miner to, up to, double the block size at any given\ntime - but penalize them. Using the normal block reward, whatever\npercentage increase the miner makes over the previous limit is taken from\nboth the normal reward and fees. The left over is rewarded to the next\nminer that finds a block.\n\nIf blocks stay smaller for an extended period of time, it goes back down to\nthe previous limit/ x amount decrease/% decrease  (up for debate)\n\nWhy would this work?: Miners only have incentive to do raise the limit when\nthey feel there is organic growth in the network. Spam attacks, block bloat\netc would have to be dealt with as it is currently. There is no incentive\nto raise the size for spam because it will subside and the penalty will\nhave been for nothing when the attack ends and block size goes back down.\n\nI believe it would have the nice side effect of forcing miners to hold the\nwhole block chain. I believe SPV does not allow you to see all the\ntransactions in a block and be able to calculate if you should be adding\nmore to your reward transaction if the last miner made the blocks bigger.\nBecause of this, the miners would also have an eye on blockchain size and\nwont want it getting huge too fast (outsize of Moore's law of Nielsen's\nLaw). Adding to the gamification.\n\nThis system would encourage block size growth due to organic growth and the\npenalty would encourage it to be slow as to still keep reward high and\npreserve ROE.\n\nWhat this would look like: The miners start seeing what looks like natural\nnetwork growth, and make the decision (or program an algorithm, the beauty\nis it leaves the \"how\" up to the miners) to increase the blocksize. They\nthink that, in the long run, having larger blocks will increase their\nrevenue and its worth taking the hit now for more fees later. They increase\nthe size to 1.25 MB. As a result, they reward would be 18.75 (75%). The\nminer fees were .5BTC. The miner fees are also reduced to .375BTC. Everyone\nwho receives that block can easily calculate 1) if the previous miner gave\nthemselves the proper reward 2) what the next reward should be if they win\nit. Miners now start building blocks with a 31.25 reward transaction and\nminer fee + .125.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150806/469dd347/attachment-0001.html>"

Assume there's a huge backlog of fee-paying transactions, such that you\ncan trivially fill 1MB, and easily fill 1.25MB for the forseeable future;\nfee per MB is roughly stable at \"f\". Then at any point in time, a miner has\nthe choice between receiving 25 + f btc, or increasing the blocksize to 1+p\nMB and earning (25+f+pf) * (1-p) = f-ppf = 25(1-p) + f(1-pp) < 25+f. Even\nif you think bigger blocks are good long term, wouldn't you reason that\nother people will think so too, so why pay the price for it yourself,\ninstead of waiting for someone else to pay it and just reaping the benefit?\n\n\nAn idea I've been pondering is having the block size adjustable in\nproportion to fees being paid. Something like \"a block is invalid if\na(B-c)*B > F\" where B is the block's size, F is the total fees for the\nblock, and a and c are scaling parameters -- either hardcoded in bitcoin,\nor dynamically adjusted by miner votes. ATM, bitcoin's behavour is\neffectively the same as setting c=1MB, a>=21M BTC/byte.\n\nHaving a more reasonable value for a would make it much easier to produce a\nfee market for bitcoin transactions -- if the blocksize is currently around\nsome specific \"B\", then the average cost per byte of a transaction is just\n\"a(B-c)\". If you pay more than that, then a miner will include your txn\nsooner, increasing the blocksize beyond average if necessary; if you pay\nless, you may have to wait for a lull in transactions so that the blocksize\nends up being smaller than average and miners can afford to include your\ntransaction (or someone might send an unnecessarily high fee paying txn\nthrough, and yours might get swept along with it).\n\nTo provide some real numbers, you need to make some assumptions on fee\nlevels. If you're happy with:\n\n - 1 MB blocks are fine, even if no one's paying any fees\n - if people are paying 0.1 mBTC / kB (=0.1 BTC/MB) in fees on average then\n8MB is okay\n\nthen a(1-c)=0, so c=1MB, and a(8-1)=0.1, so a=0.0143 and the scaling works\nout like:\n\n - 1MB blocks: free transactions, no fees\n - 2MB blocks: 0.0143 mBTC/kB, 0.02 btc in fees/block\n - 4MB blocks: 0.043 mBTC/kB, 0.17 btc in fees/block\n - 8MB blocks: 0.1 mBTC/kB, 0.8 btc in fees/block\n - 20MB blocks: 0.27 mBTC/kB, 5.4 btc in fees/block\n - 40MB blocks: 0.56 mBTC/kB, 22 btc in fees/block\n\nIn the short term, miners can just maximise fees for a block -- ie, add the\nhighest fee/byte txns in order until adding the next one would invalidate\nthe block.\n\nOver the long term, you'd still want to be able to adjust a and c -- as the\nprice of bitcoin in USD/real terms goes up, a should decrease\nproportionally; as hardware/software improve, a should decrease and/or c\nshould increase.  Essentially miners would want to choose a,c such that the\nmarket for block space clears at a price of some $x/byte, where $x is\ndetermined by their costs -- ie, hardware/software constraints. If they set\na too high, or c too low, then they'll be unable to accept some\ntransactions offering $x/byte, and thus lose out. If they set a too low or\nc too high, they'll be mining bigger blocks for less reward, and lose out\nthat way too. At the moment, I think it's a bit of both problems -- c is\ntoo low (meaning some transactions get dropped), but a is too high (meaning\nfees are too low to pay for the effort of bigger blocks).\n\nNote that, as described, miners could try cheating this plan by making a\nhigh fee transaction to themselves but not publishing it -- they'll collect\nthe fee anyway, and now they can mine arbitrarily large blocks. You could\nmitigate this by having a(B-c) set the /minimum/ fee/byte of every\ntransaction in a block, or alternatively by enforcing each miner pay a\nsignificant %ge of collected fees to the miner of the next block(s).\n\n\u200bCheers,\naj\u200b\n\n-- \nAnthony Towns <aj at erisian.com.au>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150807/5cb3837b/attachment-0001.html>"

If the total production rate is higher,\neven without configured floor by miners, a free transaction won't ever be\nmined, as there will always be some backlog of non-free transaction. Not\nsaying that this is a likely outcome - it would inevitably mean that people\nare creating transactions without any guarantee that they'll be mined,\nwhich may not be what anyone is interested in.

                "message_text_only": "Peter's proposal undercuts matching blocksize growth to technological\nprogress not limiting centralization pressure.  They are somewhat related,\nbut I want to be clear on what I originally stated.  I would also point out\nthat Peter's proposal lacks this technical criteria as well.\n\nThat being said, I think designing any growth rates on theoretical\ncentralization pressure is not sensible and Peter's proposal rightly\nexcludes it and attempts instead for a very gradual increase over time\nattempting to match blocksize growth that is consistent with technological\nbandwidth growth.  The problem is that it ignores the last 6 years (we are\nalready \"behind\") and underestimates bandwidth and storage growth. (See\nNielsen's law which states 50% and has held for 30 years).\n\nPeter seems to be of the belief that since bitcoin will never be able to\nhandle all the world's transactions we should instead \"...decrease the need\nfor trust required in off-chain systems...\".  This is akin to basing all\nthe world's transactions on a small settlement layer, much like balancing a\npyramid upside down it will topple.\n\nI'm of the belief that the \"reasonable node\" test is a simple enough test\nto maintain decentralization.\n\nA raspberry pie 2 node on reasonable Internet connection with a reasonable\nhard drive can run a node with 8 or 20mb blocks easily.\n\nAs Peter's proposal indicates, \"If over time, this growth factor is beyond\nwhat the actual technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a\ntighter limit.\"  I wholeheartedly agree, which is why we should plan to be\nahead of the curve...not behind it.\nOn Aug 7, 2015 2:15 PM, \"Mark Friedenbach\" <mark at friedenbach.org> wrote:\n\n> Surely you have some sort of empirical measurement demonstrating the\n> validity of that statement?

I agree with you that\nthe most likely outcome is that fees will rise to a new equilibrium as\ncompetition for block space increases, and some use cases will get priced\nout of the market. If fees rise high enough, the effects of this can be\npretty bad though. I get the sense that you don't think high fees are that\nbad / low fees are that good.\n\nCan you let me know which of these statements related to low fees you\ndisagree with?\n\n(0) Bitcoin's security will eventually have to be paid for almost entirely\nvia txn fees.\n\n(1) A future in which lots of users are making on chain txns and each\npaying 5 cents/tx is more sustainable than one in which a smaller number of\nusers are paying $3/tx, all else being equal (pretend the centralization\npressures are very low in both instances, and each scenario results in the\nsame amount of total tx fees).\n\n(2) It's important that Bitcoin become widely used to protect the network\nagainst regulators (note how political pressure from users who like Uber\nhave had a huge effect on preventing Uber from being banned in many\nlocations).\n\n(3) There are potentially a lot of valuable use cases that can benefit from\nBitcoin's decentralization which can work at 5 cents / tx but are nonviable\nat $3 / tx. Allowing fees to stay at $3 / tx and pricing out all the viable\nuse cases between $3 and 5 cents / tx would likely result in a significant\nloss of utility for people who want these use cases to work.\n\n(4) The Lightning Network will be a lot less appealing at $3 / tx than 5\ncents / tx, because it'll require much larger anchor txn values to\nsufficiently amortize the costs of the Bitcoin tx fees, and having to pay\n$3 each time your counter-party misbehaves is somewhat painful.\n\n(5) Assuming that Bitcoin is somewhat likely to end up in the \"lots of\nusers, lower fees\" situation described in (1), it's important that people\ncan experiment with low fee use cases now so that these use cases have time\nto be discovered, be improved, and become popular before Bitcoin's security\nrelies exclusively on fees.\n\n\nFinally, here's a type of question that devs on this list really don't like\nanswering but which I think is more informative than almost any other: If\nyou knew that hard forking to 4 MB soon would keep fees around 5 cents\n(with a fee market) for the next two years, and that remaining at 1 MB\nwould result in fees of around $1 for the next two years, would you be in\nfavor of the 4 MB hard fork? (I know our knowledge of the decentralization\nrisks isn't very complete now, but assume you had to make a decision given\nthe state of your knowledge now).\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150811/af01b4aa/attachment-0001.html>"

In the upcoming release the actual CPU load should also get \nbetter making the actual download much much faster than the 0.9 release.\n\nOr, in other words, these problems have been solved in a large part already, \nand more is underway.\nI don't expect them to be showstoppers when a the network finally allows bigger \nthan 1Mb blocks.

I agree with the other stuff\nyou wrote.  Thanks for confirming that it is difficult.\n\nI did some research on replace by fee (FSS-RBF) and on\nChild-pays-for-parent (CPFP).  You point out that these solutions to paying\ntoo-low fees are \"not supported in the vast majority...\".  Do you mean\nphilosophically or programmatically?  The trend seems to me toward\nimprovements, just as I insinuated may be necessary (\"perhaps that's not as\neasy as it should be in bitcoin core\"), so, once again, I have to reiterate\nthat transaction backlog has valuable solutions other than increasing the\nblock size.\n\nI also realized that we have already been through a period of full blocks,\nso that tremendously reduces the value I see in doing it again.  It was\nthat \"spam\" test someone ran that did it for us, and I love that.  It seems\nto have kicked the fee-increasability efforts in the butt, which is great.\n\nI now place a higher priority on enabling senders to increase their fee\nwhen necessary than on increasing the Txns per second that the network can\nhandle.  The competition between these two is rather unfair because of how\neasy it is to apply the \"N MB-blocks bandaid\".\n\nDave\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150809/01523c01/attachment-0001.html>"

I have read gavin's blog posts as well, several times.\nI still don't see what else can we fear from not increasing the size apart\nfrom fees maybe rising and making some problems that need to be solved\nrewardless of the size more visible (like a dumb unbounded mempool design).\n\nThis discussion is frustrating for everyone.

More broadly: how do you think that moving the\nblock size from 1MB to 8MB would materially impact these things?\n\nRe: \"That's why I cannot understand the urgency to rise the maximum size.\"\n\nThis issue is urgent because the difference between bitcoin being a success\nand it being forgotten hinges on it being \"better money\" than other money.\nIf people want a money that can process lots and lots of transactions at\nlow cost, they're going to get it so long as technology can give it to\nthem. While it's not critical we raise the block size this very moment\nsince we're not hitting the capacity wall right now, based on the way\ngrowth spikes in Bitcoin have occurred in the past we, may hit that\ncapacity wall soon and suddenly. And the moment we do, then Bitcoin may no\nlonger be \"better money\" since there's a big opportunity for other money\nwith higher throughput and lower fees to take its place.\n\nOn Tue, Aug 11, 2015 at 2:45 PM, Jorge Tim\u00f3n <jtimon at jtimon.cc> wrote:\n\n>\n> On Aug 11, 2015 8:55 PM, \"Michael Naber\" <mickeybob at gmail.com> wrote:\n> >\n> > It generally doesn't matter that every node validate your coffee\n> transaction, and those transactions can and will probably be moved onto\n> offchain solutions in order to avoid paying the cost of achieving global\n> consensus.

The question is what\nprice we're willing to pay for that. It is not a boolean \"at this size,\nthings break, and below it, they work\". A small constant factor increase\nwill unlikely break anything in the short term, but it will come with\nhigher centralization pressure of various forms. There is discussion about\nwhether these centralization pressures are significant, but citing that\nit's artificially constrained under the limit is IMHO a misrepresentation.\nIt is constrained to aim for a certain balance between utility and risk,\nand neither extreme is interesting, while possibly still \"working\".\n\nConsensus rules are what keeps the system together. You can't simply switch\nto new rules on your own, because the rest of the system will end up\nignoring you. These rules are there for a reason. You and I may agree about\nwhether the 21M limit is necessary, and disagree about whether we need a\nblock size limit, but we should be extremely careful with change. My\nposition as Bitcoin Core developer is that we should merge consensus\nchanges only when they are uncontroversial. Even when you believe a more\ninvasive change is worth it, others may disagree, and the risk from\ndisagreement is likely larger than the effect of a small block size\nincrease by itself: the risk that suddenly every transaction can be spent\ntwice (once on each side of the fork), the very thing that the block chain\nwas designed to prevent.\n\nMy personal opinion is that we should aim to do a block size increase for\nthe right reasons. I don't think fear of rising fees or unreliability\nshould be an issue: if fees are being paid, it means someone is willing to\npay them. If people are doing transactions despite being unreliable, there\nmust be a use for them. That may mean that some use cases don't fit\nanymore, but that is already the case.\n\n-- \nPieter\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150811/851e0acb/attachment.html>"

If that characteristic is no longer true, then Bitcoin isn't\ngoing to grow, and in fact Bitcoin itself will be replaced by better money\nthat is less expensive to transfer.\n\nSo the importance of this issue cannot be overstated -- it's compete or die\nfor Bitcoin -- because people want to transact with global consensus at\nhigh volume, and because technology exists to service that want, then it's\ngoing to be met.

                "message_text_only": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nYour concern for adoption is valid yet there are a few assumptions in\nyour discussion and they are a common thread in the current wave of\n\"bigger blocksize\" topics.\n\n1) Supplying bigger blocks will meet the demand of more people:\n\nAnyone can transact via Bitcoin. By increasing blocksize and making\nmore transactions possible at low fees, what's to stop a large\ncorporation, bank or government from using the protocol as a cheap\nsettlement mechanism. They don't have to fund or develop their own\n(well, Ecuador has, for this exact use-case) and perhaps the utility\nand capacity of the Bitcoin network means reliability and low fees\n(cheaper than a bank clearance, say) for their use-case. In the\nprocess they hog xMB of space in each block and discussion about a\ncapacity limit continues in this list. Increased supply *will* be\nutilized - by all kinds of entities - not only the girl next-door and\nthe unbanked proletariat.\n\n2) Dissatisfied users will move to alt-coins so Bitcoin better be\ncareful...\n\nThe assumption here is that the best skills and most able minds are\nfairly evenly distributed amongst alt-coin dev teams. I doubt this is\ntrue and the notion underestimates the quality of developer that is\nattracted to Bitcoin Core to apply themselves to this project, often\nself-funded. There are few (if any) comparable cryptocurrencies or cc\ndev teams out there. Hence the Bitcoin market cap, the large\nstakeholder industry, and the established brand.\n\n3) Bitcoin is better money.\n\nYes, indeed. It's genius and revolution. Yet, it does not fit every\nuse-case. I know people don't like it when I make this example, but\nit's the truth where I live, and by extension, in many places in the\nworld:\n\nI live in rural Southeast Asia. Some houses have electricity and some\ndon't: by choice, because rural lifestyle in the tropics does not\nalways require you to have electricity. People charge their mobile\nphones at the community eating house every other day. The electricity\nsupply is unreliable. I've had to rig a solar charging system to a\nUPS, but most people around here have no choice but to deal with\nintermittent power cuts. The local market has a diesel generator, so\nconstant electricity, but if a power cut lasts for long enough the\nlocal cellular mast battery backup depletes and then there is no\ncellular connectivity - the only means of accessing the internet.\n\nNow, how does one expect this community to use or adopt\ncryptocurrency? They are mostly unbanked, get paid fiat wages at the\nend of the week and spend fiat on commodities, rent, food and\nentertainment like the rest of the world. But Bitcoin is not a \"better\nmoney\" in their case, and who knows for how long this condition will\nremain true.\n\n4) TBD\n\nThe notion that there be dragons at the capacity limit is unfounded\nand reactionary. We have to make the journey and find out what is, in\nfact, there at the edge - as many others have argued in the list. This\nis our opportunity to make scientific observation and discovery for\nthe benefit of Bitcoin - while it is still in its early years and the\ncapacity limit untested.\n\nWho knows? The outcome may be an informed decision to implement bigger\nblocks. Informed. Based not on fear and uncertainty but on empirical\nobservation and facts.\n\n\n\nOn 08/12/2015 04:39 AM, Michael Naber via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n> Sure, most people probably would be happy with cheaper off-chain \n> systems.

For any\nspecific use case of Bitcoin, that use case will be more reliable with a\nlarger block size (ignoring centralization effects).\n\nThe effect that I think you're talking about is that with lower fees, some\nuse cases will exist that otherwise wouldn't have been possible with higher\nfees / smaller blocks, and these \"low fee only\" use cases will not be as\nreliable as the use cases you'd see with high fees. But that puts you in a\nposition or arguing that it's better that low fee use cases never exist at\nall, than existing at some high risk of being priced out eventually. Do we\nknow with high confidence how high tx fees will be in the future? Should it\nbe up to us discourage low fee use cases from being tried, because we think\nthe risk that they'll later be priced out is too great? Shouldn't we let\nthe people developing those use cases make that call? Maybe they don't mind\nthe unreliability. Maybe it's worth it to them if their use case only lasts\nfor a few months.\n\nThe important point to note is that the reliability of a use case is\ndetermined by the fees that people are willing to pay for that use case,\nnot the fees that are actually paid. If big banks are willing to pay $1 /\ntx for some use case right now, but they only need 200 of these txns per\nblock, then they might be paying only 5 cents / tx because no one is\nforcing them to pay more. The fact that they're only paying 5 cents / tx\nnow doesn't make them any more vulnerable to new use cases than if they\nwere paying $1 / tx now. If a new use case started bidding up tx fees, the\nbanks would just increase their tx fees as high as they needed to (up to\n$1).\n\nThe reason that larger block sizes increase reliability for any given use\ncase is that (a) You will never be priced out of blocks by a use case that\nis only willing to pay lower fees than you. This is true regardless of the\nblock size. At worst they'll just force you to pay more in fees and lose\nsome of your consumer surplus. (b) If a use case is willing to pay higher\nfees than you, then they're basically stepping ahead of you in line for\nblock space and pushing you closer to the edge of not being included in\nblocks. The more space that exists between your use case and the marginal\nuse cases that are just barely getting included in blocks, the less\nvulnerable you are to getting pushed out of blocks by new use cases.\n\nIf this is tricky to understand, here's an example that will make it clear:\n\nAssume blocks can hold 2000 txns per MB. Before the new use case is\ndiscovered, demand looks like this:\n\n500 txns will pay $1 fees\n1000 txns will pay 50 cent fees\n2000 txns will pay 5 cent fees\n8000 txns will pay 2 cent fees\n15,000 txns will pay 1 cent fees.\n100,000 txns will pay 0.01 cent fees.\n\nSo at a block size of 1MB, fees are 5 cents and user surplus is $925 per\nblock ($0.95 * 500 + 0.45 * 1000).\nAt a block size of 8 MB, fees are 1 cent and user surplus is $1,145 per\nblock ($0.99 * 500 + 0.49 * 1000 + $0.04 * 2000 + $0.01 * 8000).\n\nNow a new use case comes into play and this is added to demand:\n\n3000 txns will pay $5 / tx\n\nThat demand changes the scenarios like such:\n\nAt 1 MB fees jump to $5, user surplus is $0, and the $925 of value the\nprevious users were getting is lost. All existing use cases are priced out,\nbecause there wasn't enough room in the blocks to accommodate them plus\nthis new use case.\n\nAt 8 MB, fees would stay at 1 cent, user surplus would be $16,115, and $0\nin value would be lost (3000 users who were paying 1 cent for txns that\nthey valued only at 1 cent would stop making txns). All use cases\ncorresponding to the txns that were willing to pay at least 2 cents are\nstill viable, because there was enough space in blocks to accommodate them\nplus the 3000 new high fee txns.\n\nLet's say you're running the service that represents the 2000 txns willing\nto pay 5 cents each on the demand curve specified above. Let's say you're\nworried about being priced out of blocks. Which situation do you want to be\nin, the one with 1 MB blocks or 8 MB blocks? It's pretty clear that your\nbest chance to remain viable is with larger blocks.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150811/7e2e6848/attachment-0001.html>"

That is why\nthe developers and thinkers with the deepest understanding of this\nprotocol are pointing out the need for another layer on top of\nBitcoin.

Have you\nconsidered why is it comparatively inexpensive to transact in a medium\nthat is based on such a highly inefficient technology?\n\nYou might want to consider that these two considerations are not\nindependent.

Bitcoin economy is absolutely tiny and there is a \nhuge amount of growth possible.  It can only grow.\n\n\n> And if you see Bitcoin as a payment system where guaranteed time to\n> confirmation is a feature, I fully agree.\n\nNaturally, that is a usecase.  But not really one that enters my mind. It \ncertainly is not a requirement to have guaranteed time.\n\nThe situation is much simpler than that.\nWe have maybe 0,007% of the world population using Bitcoin once a month. (half \na million people).  And I'm being very optimistic with that number...\nThis should give you an idea of how much growth is possible.\n\nThere is no doubt at all that the 1Mb blocks will get full, continuously, if \nwe get to a higher rate of usage. Even with the vast majority of users using \nBitcoin off-chain.\n\nAs such its not about a guaranteed time-to confirmation. Its about a \nconfirmation before I die.\n\n> If you want transactions to be cheap, it will also be cheap to make them\n> unreliable.\n\nIts not about transactions being cheap. The fee market is completely \nirrelevant to the block size. If you think otherwise you are delusional.\nThe reason it is irrelevant is because when the system starts consistently \ndropping transactions when user count goes up, and when that happens the \nBitcoin network looses value because people don't put value in something that \nis unreliable.\n\nThis is simple economy 101.\nLook at history; so many great companies made great products that had more \nfeatures, but didn't make it because their competition might have been slower \nto market, but it was actually reliable.\n-- \nThomas Zander"

Assuming that rate remains similar with an increased block size, that remains cheap.\n\n\nApologies, this is going to be long but please read it...\n\nFor starters, f the \u201cminimum relay fee\u201d is 0.0001 BTC, and the proven throughput from the recent stress tests was 2.3 trx/second, it\u2019s 0.0001 x 2.3 x 60 x 60 x 24 or 19.872 BTC to fill up the block chain for 24 hours, not 1.5 BTC.\n\nThe math error isn\u2019t important, because the premise of what you are saying is based on a misconception.  No one is advocating that we should price fix transaction fees at some tiny amount to guarantee cheap transactions.  Furthermore, it\u2019s perfectly realistic to believe bitcoin can scale reliably without constraining the block size to 1MB, given certain constraints.\n\nA quick disclosure, I run a small bitcoin startup that benefits from higher bitcoin prices and more people buying bitcoin with their fiat currency. I also have an inadvisably high percentage of my remaining personal savings denominated in bitcoin.\n\nBack to the point, limiting block size to impose fee pressure is a well intentioned idea that is built on a misconception of how bitcoin's economics work.  The price of bitcoin is based on the perceived value of units inside the protocol. Keeping transaction volumes through the bitcoin protocol capped at around 2.3 transactions / second limits the number of new people who can use bitcoin to around 100,000 people performing a little under 2 transactions daily.  This is only a tiny bit more use than where we are presently. It\u2019s forced stagnation.\n\nPlease, read and understand: constraining the network affect and adoption of bitcoin lowers its overall value, and by extension reduces its price as denominated in other currencies.  The only alternatives presently to on blockchain transactions are centralized bank ledgers at exchanges or similar companies.  Yes, while capping the bitcoin max_block_size to a level that restricts use will drive transaction fees higher, it will also reduce the underlying price of bitcoin as denominated in other currencies, because the outside observer will see bitcoin stagnating and failing to grow like a nascent but promising technology should.  Higher fees combined with lower bitcoin price negates the value of the higher fees, and the only side effect is to stymie adoption in the process, while putting more focus on layer protocols that are no where near ready for mainstream, stable use!  \n\nRemoving the cap entirely is also a catastrophically poor idea, because some group of jerks out there will absolutely make sure that every block is 32 MB, making it a real PITA for a hobbyist to get interested in bitcoin.  Yes, some miners limit blocksize in order to balance propagation times against transaction fee revenue, so there is already a mechanism in place to push transaction fees higher by limiting size or not including transactions without fees that could offset a spam happy bad actor or group of actors, but we cannot leave that to chance.  The damage is too high to allow the risk.  Bitcoin is going to grow because each new curious, technically savvy kid who learns about it can download and participate as a full node.  We\u2019re not anywhere close to mainstream adoption or at a level of maturity where the protocol is fully baked, so we have an obligation to keep full nodes within the grasp of a starving college kid\u2019s budget.  That is the barometer here in my mind.  \n\n40% should be our best guess for keeping bitcoin in reach of hobbyists, and safer from more napsteresque node centralization.  It's simple, which makes it less prone to failure and being picked apart politically as well.  It may be too fast, or it may be too slow, but it\u2019s probably a good guess for 5 years, and if history holds true, it will work for a long time and make the cost of running a node lower gradually as well.  No one can predict the future, but this is the best we have.  No one knows if it will be radio propagation of blocks, quantum spin liquid based storage or data transmission, or some other breakthrough that drives down costs, but something always seems to appear that keeps the long term trends intact.  So why wouldn\u2019t we use these trends?\n\n8MB is about 40% annually from January 2009 to today.  I can buy a 5TB external hard drive right now online for $130.00 in the US.  The true block time is just over 9 minutes, so that\u2019s 160 blocks a day x 8MB x 365.25 days a year, or around 467.52GB of new block size annually.  This is 10.69 years of storage for $130.00, or a little over $12 a year - which is darn close to what the cost was back in late 2010 when I first learned about this stuff...  I fail to see the \u201ccentralization\" issue here, and when we contrast $12/year for hobbyists against the centralization risks of mining pools, we should all be ashamed to have wasted so much energy and time talking about this specific point.  The math does not add up, and it\u2019s not a significant centralization risk when we put an 8MB cap on this with 40% annual average growth.  The energy we\u2019ve blown on this topic should have been put into refining privacy, and solving mining pool centralization.  There are so many more important problems.\n\nLet's talk about other ideas for a moment.  First, while lightning is really cool and I believe it will be an exponential magnifier for bitcoin someday, that day is NOT today.  Waiting for layers over bitcoin to solve a self-imposed limit of 1mb is just a terrible, horrible idea for the health of the protocol.  Lightning is really well thought through, but there are still problems that need to be solved.  Forced channel expiration, transaction malleability are the theoretical issues that must be solved.  There WILL be issues that aren\u2019t anticipated and known today when it goes out \u201cinto the wild\u201d.  Protocols of this complexity do not go from white paper to stability in less than one to two years.  Remember, even the bitcoin reference client had a catastrophic bug 1.5 years after its January 2009 launch in August 2010.  I read here that the \"deepest thinkers\" believe we should wait for overlays to solve this bottleneck, well, bluntly, that is far from practical or pragmatic, and is \u201civory tower\u201d thinking.  Discussing approaches like this are worse than agreeing to do nothing, because it drains our attention away from other more pressing issues that have a time limit on our ability to solve them before the protocol crystallizes from the scale of the network effect (like privacy, mining centralization, etc.) on top of accomplishing little of immediate value other than academic debates.\n\nI\u2019m not winning any popularity contests today\u2026 but it was a bad idea to approach this as we did with XT.  We should have put in a solution that addressed just the cap size issue and nothing more.  Other changes, pork, and changing the nature of the community management around the XT client is just too much political baggage to work without fracturing the support of the community.  And guess what happened?  We have the major community forum moderators actively censoring posts, banning users, and things are looking to the outside observer as if the entire system is starting to fall in on itself.  Truth is ladies and gentlemen, our egos and economic interests are creating a tragedy of the commons that will hurt the lot of us far more than it will help the best off of us.  Yeah, I get that no one wants to code in a hostile environment, and this community has definitely turned caustic and behaves like a mob of petulant children, but sometimes you have to suck it up and get things done. \n\nSo\u2026 what do we do?  We should get our @#$@ together, stop the academic grand standing and ego driven debates, raise the cap to 8mb and permit an average growth of 40% a year, then get back to solving real problems and working on layer and side chain magnifiers.  Allowing bitcoin to grow reasonably allows adoption to spread, the price to rise, which creates more demand, higher prices, and more fees.  Again, because the fees and coinbase rewards are denominated in bitcoin, this increases the return to miners.  This, combined with allowing for growth will encourage the price to rise, and increase stability for layers and side chains later on down the road when the technology is stable and mature.\n\nFor the love of whatever it is you care about, can we please just get this done?  Do I have to go brush up on my C++ and start asking everyone obnoxious, amateur questions?  Trust me, no one wants that.  Let\u2019s just get the cap raised to 8MB + 40% on average annualized and fight viciously about privacy or mining centralization.  Something more important.  \n\nThanks.\n\n\n> On Aug 10, 2015, at 8:34 AM, Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> \n> On Mon, Aug 10, 2015 at 4:12 PM, Gavin Andresen <gavinandresen at gmail.com <mailto:gavinandresen at gmail.com>> wrote:\n> \n> Executive summary: when networks get over-saturated, they become unreliable.

Yes we all want Bitcoin to scale such that every person\nin the world can use it without difficulty. However if that were all that\nwe cared about then I would be remiss if I did not point out that there are\nplenty of better, faster, and cheaper solutions to finding global consensus\nover a payment ledger than Bitcoin. Architectures which are algorithmically\nsuperior in their scaling properties. Indeed they are already implemented\nand you can use them today:\n\nhttps://www.stellar.org/\nhttp://opentransactions.org/\n\nSo why do I work on Bitcoin, and why do I care about the outcome of this\ndebate? Because Bitcoin offers one thing, and one thing only which\nalternative architectures fundamentally lack: policy neutrality. It can't\nbe censored, it can't be shut down, and the rules cannot change from\nunderneath you. *That* is what Bitcoin offers that can't be replicated at\nhigher scale with a SQL database and an audit log.\n\nIt follows then, that if we make a decision now which destroys that\nproperty, which makes it possible to censor bitcoin, to deny service, or to\npressure miners into changing rules contrary to user interests, then\nBitcoin is no longer interesting. We might as well get rid of mining at\nthat point and make Bitcoin look like Stellar or Open-Transactions because\nat least then we'd scale even better and not be pumping millions of tons of\nCO2 into the atmosphere from running all those ASICs.\n\nOn the other side, 3Tb harddrives are sold, which take 8Mb blocks without\n> problems.\n>\n\nStraw man, storage is not an issue.\n\n\n> You can buy broadband in every relevant country that easily supports the\n> bandwidth we need. (remember we won't jump to 8Mb in a day, it will likely\n> take at least 6 months).\n>\n\nNeither one of those assertions is clear. Keep in mind the goal is to have\nBitcoin survive active censorship. Presumably that means being able to run\na node even in the face of a hostile ISP or government. Furthermore, it\nmeans being location independent and being able to move around. In many\nplaces the higher the bandwidth requirements the fewer the number of ISPs\nthat are available to service you, and the more visible you are.\n\nIt may also be necessary to be able to run over Tor. And not just today's\nTor which is developed, serviced, and supported by the US government, but a\nTor or I2P that future governments have turned hostile towards and actively\ncensor or repress. Or existing authoritative governments, for that matter.\nHow much bandwidth would be available through those connections?\n\nIt may hopefully never be necessary to operate under such constraints,\nexcept by freedom seeking individuals within existing totalitarian regimes.\nHowever the credible threat of doing so may be what keeps Bitcoin from\nbeing repressed in the first place. Lose the capability to go underground,\nand it will be pressured into regulation, eventually.\n\nTo the second point, it has been previously pointed out that large miners\nstand to gain from larger blocks, for the same basic underlying reasons as\nselfish mining. The incentive is to increase blocks, and miners are able to\ndo so at will and without cost. I would not be so certain that we wouldn't\nsee large blocks sooner than that.\n\n\n> We should get the inverted bloom filters stuff (or competing products)\n> working\n> at least on a one-to-one basis so we can solve the propagation time\n> problem.\n> There frankly is a huge amount of optimization that can be done in that\n> area,\n> we don't even use locality (pingtime) to optimize distribution.\n> From my experience you can expect a 2-magnitude speedup in that same 6\n> month\n> period by focusing some research there.\n>\n\nThis is basically already deployed thanks to Matt's relay network.

And 8GB/block is ludicrously large -- it would absolutely,\nwithout any doubt destroy the very nature of Bitcoin, turning it into a\nfundamentally uninteresting reincarnation of the existing financial system.\nAnd still be unable to compete with VISA/Mastercard.\n\nSo why then the pressure to go down a route that WILL lead to failure by\nyour own metrics?\n\nI humbly suggest that maybe we should play the strengths of Bitcoin instead\n-- it's trustlessness via policy neutrality.\n\nEither that, or go work on Stellar. Because that's where it's headed\notherwise.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150811/97ad8981/attachment-0001.html>"

                "message_text_only": "More people using Bitcoin does not necessarily mean more transactions being\nprocessed by the block chain. Satoshi was forward-thinking enough to\ninclude a powerful script-signature system, something which has never\nreally existed before. Though suffering from some limitations to be sure,\nthis smart contract execution framework is expressive enough to enable a\nwide variety of new features without changing bitcoin itself.\n\nOne of these invented features is micropayment channels -- the ability for\ntwo parties to rapidly exchange funds while only settling the final balance\nto the block chain, and to do so in an entirely trustless way. Right now\npeople don't use scripts to do interesting things like this, but there is\nabsolutely no reason why they can't. Lightning network is a vision of a\nfuture where everyone uses a higher-layer protocol for their transactions\nwhich only periodically settle on the block chain. It is entirely possible\nthat you may be able to do all your day-to-day transactions in bitcoin yet\nonly settle accounts every other week, totaling 13kB per year.

Security is quite central to this discussion.  It is\nunrealistic in my opinion to suppose that everything can fit directly\non-chain in the fullest Bitcoin adoption across cash-payments, internet of\nthings, QoS, micropayments, share-trading, derivates etc.  Hence the\ninterest in protocols like lightning (encourage you and others to read the\npaper, blog posts and implementation progress on the lightning-dev mailing\nlist).\n\nMid-term different tradeoffs can happen that are all connected to and\nbuilding on Bitcoin.  But whatever technologies win out for scale, they all\ndepend on Bitcoin security - anything built on Bitcoin requires a secure\nbase.  So I think it is logical that we strive to maintain and improve\nBitcoin security.  Long-term tradeoffs that significantly weaken security\nfor throughput or other considerations should be built on top of Bitcoin,\nand avoiding creating a one-size fits all unfortunate compromise that\nweakens Bitcoin to the lowest common denominator of centralisation,\ninsecurity and throughput tradeoffs.  This pattern (secure base, other\nprotocols built on top) is already the status quo - probably > 99% of\nBitcoin transactions are off-chain already (in exchanges, web wallets\netc).

The system as a whole will work just fine for people in totalitarian \nregimes as long as 100% of the world doesn't reach that point.\nWith various nodes in Sealand (near the UK) and miners in China, the system \nwould still work for users in New York.\n\n> > Remember 8Gb/block still doesn't support VISA/Mastercard.\n> \n> No, it doesn't.

There\nis an alternative visual picture of the subject at:\nhttp://is.gd/vFgYrf\nThe upshot of that is that web wallets (which are popularized due to\nconvenience) cannot be considered to provide users with control over\ntheir money - extended discussion on this here in the bitcoin.org\nrepository:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/996\n\nMy question, therefore is this:\nWhen you say \"it will be pressured into regulation, eventually,\" what\ndo you mean? Are you implying that even the hardware wallets and\ndesktop wallets for bitcoin will be regulated to the point where they\ncannot be used by individuals who actually care about being able to\ncircumvent financial censorship?  If so, explain how that is the case.\n\n I could see an argument where that might be the case to some degree\nif you would mention it in the context of services like Chainalysis\nand other companies that are in the process of setting up services for\ncorporation-states for \"virtual currency compliance;\" e.g.; if\nactivity can be scanned and if a state has a requirement you are\nsupposed to be registered with the state to use virtual currency at\nsome level, and if companies scan the blockchain and report this\ninformation to states (as they now do), then as you say, the only\nreasonable method of using virtual currencies would be one in which\nlocation is masked and information about the nodes and history of\ntransactions can be hidden.  However, this requires more privacy and\nanonymity effort in bitcoin development, but I don't think it would\nactually keep people from using hardware and desktop wallets (although\nI do think eventually people will, as they are beginning to now, be\ngradually censored more and more from utilizing web wallets for\nactivities that they desire).\n\nIt seems to me that the existence of various tools and conditions\n(external to the whole issue of legal constraints) are also very\nimportant.  For example, various companies have recently made public\nannouncements that they will leave (or not operate in) New York due to\nBitlicense - Kraken, Shapeshift.io, poloniex, and others.  It's\nunderstandable given the extreme nature of NY's approach (I personally\noppose any regulation of virtual currencies).  But technically, they\ndidn't have to cease operating, did they?  This was a failure in their\nbusiness model.  They made a big statement about how evil NY was and\nfled the scene, perhaps never to return to serve NY.  (Note, I don't\nlive in NY, so I'm not personally being left out in the cold when\nKraken etc. leave, for the record.) As said, this was a failure in\nKraken, poloniex's, shapeshift's, etc., business model.  Why?  Because\nhere we are talking about web-based services.  A distributed,\ndecentralized, peer-to-peer model in which the user has a piece of\nsoftware on their computer (think openbazaar or bitsquare) is far and\naway better than services which are web based.  Why?  Because systems\nwhich are set up such as (openbazaar, bitsquare) don't have to worry\nabout the constraints of state boundaries or shifting legal things,\nnor do the people who made the software end up holding keys on behalf\nof the users.  If Kraken, poloniex, etc., had bothered to develop\ncontingency software (similar to what is being worked on with\nhttps://bitsquare.io/ for example) for users who might be affected in\njurisdictions where corporation-states Just Don't Get It (read... NY,\nand possibly CA, as examples) then maybe they wouldn't have to worry\nabout it at all.  It just would be a matter of users installing a\npiece of software from their website, discontinuing the web-based\nexchange for that state, and directing users for highly regulated\nstates to a download page for the decentralized exchange software.\nNot that hard really - but something we haven't seen done yet by the\nbig exchanges.\n\nI have another question for you below...\n\n> \n> To the second point, it has been previously pointed out that large \n> miners stand to gain from larger blocks, for the same basic\n> underlying reasons as selfish mining.

Once the block\nsubsidy is retired, hashpower is only paid for by fees -- and if there's no\nfee paying transactions in the queue, then there's no reward for applying\nhashpower, so mining a block won't even pay for your costs.

If demand for space within a particular block is elevated (e.g., when the network has not found a block for 30 minutes), the minimum fee density for inclusion will be greater than the minimum fee density when demand for space is low (e.g., when the network has found several blocks in quick succession, as Gavin pointed out).  Lower-fee paying transaction will just wait to be included at one of the network lulls where a bunch of blocks were found quickly in a row.  \n\nThe feemarket.pdf paper ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf ) shows that this will always be the case so long as the block space supply curve (i.e., the cost in BTC/byte to supply additional space within a block [rho]) is a monotonically-increasing function of the block size (refer to Fig. 6 and Table 1).  The curve will satisfy this condition provided the propagation time for block solutions grows faster than log Q where Q is the size of the block.  Assuming that block solutions are propagated across physical channels, and that the quantity of pure information communicated per solution is proportional to the amount of information contained within the block, then the communication time will always grow asymptotically like O(Q) as per the Shannon-Hartely theorem, and the fee market will be healthy.  \n\nBest regards,\nPeter\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150807/95eeef01/attachment.html>"

Lose the capability to go underground,\n>and it will be pressured into regulation, eventually.\n\nI agree on the importance of having the credible threat of being able to\noperate in the underground, and for the reasons you outlined.  However, I\nsee that threat as being inherent in the now-public-knowledge that a system\nlike Bitcoin can exist.  The smart governments already know that\nBitcoin-like systems are unstoppable phenomena, that they can operate over\nTor and I2P, that they can and do run without central servers, and that\nthey can be run on commodity hardware without detection.  Bitcoin itself\ndoes not need to constantly operate in survival-mode, hunkered down, and\nalways ready for big brother\u2019s onslaught, to benefit from the protection of\nthe \u2018credible threat\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s important to accurately asses the level of threat the Bitcoin system\nfaces from regulation, legislation, and government \u2018operations\u2019.  If we are\ntoo paranoid, we are going to waste resources or forgo opportunities in the\nname of, essentially, baseless fear.  When I got involved with this project\nin 2012, no one really knew how governments were going to react.  Had an\nall out war-on-Bitcoin been declared, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say the\nstructure of the network would look different than it does today.  We would\nprobably be discussing ways to disguise Bitcoin traffic to look like VoIP\ncalls, not talking about how to best scale the network.  In light of the\ncurrent regulatory climate surrounding Bitcoin, I believe the best security\nagainst a state-sponsored / political crackdown to be gained at this time\ncomes from growing the user base and use cases, as opposed to hardening and\nfortifying the protocol.  Uber is a great example of this form of\nsecurity-though-adoption, as was mentioned earlier today on this mailing\nlist.\n\nIf there are security or network-hardening measures that don\u2019t come at the\nexpense of growing the user base and use cases, then there is no reason not\nto adopt them.  The recent improvements in Tor routing are a great example\nof a security improvement that in no meaningful way slows Bitcoin\u2019s\npotential growth.  How does this relate to the Blocksize debate?  Let\u2019s\naccept that 8 MB blocks might cause a little bit, and perhaps even a\n\u2018medium bit\u2019 (however that is measured), of centralization.  Although the\nnetwork might be slightly more vulnerable to government attack, if millions\nmore people are able to join the system as a result, I\u2019d wager the overall\nsecurity situation would be stronger, owning to greatly decreased risk of\nattack.\n\n-Corey (CubicEarth)\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150811/41b60844/attachment.html>"

So their\nsolution is passing a new law that says only one commercial air plane is\nallowed to be in the air at any given time.\n\nThis should help a ticket market to develop and prevent air lines from\ngiving away almost free tickets. In this way the government can protect\nthe air lines from themselves.\n\nI would not classify all issues that would come out of this as\n\"potential indirect consequences of rising ticket prices.\"\n\nIt would just make air travel unusable.\n\nThat's the problem we may face in the short term.\n\nIt would be unwise to go all-in on a solution that doesn't exist yet,\nwhich may or may not arrive in time, and may or may not do the job that\nis needed. We need to use the solution we already have so that we can\nget by in the short term.\n\nI don't think mining pools will immediately make blocks as big as\npossible if the hard limit is raised. Remember that mining pools had to\nbe coaxed into increasing their block size. Mining pools were making\nsmall blocks to reduce the rate of orphaned blocks. Block propagation is\nfaster today, but this issue still exists. You need a lot of transaction\nfees to make up for the danger of losing 25 BTC. Many pools don't even\npay out transaction fee income to their miners.\n\n-- \nRegards,\nGeir H. Hansen, Bitminter mining pool"

If your application supports multiple identities/wallets, does\n> each one connect to the network as if it were completely independent from\n> the other?\n>\n\nNo built-in support for multiple identities. You can hotswap wallet files\nto crudely simulate this. You'd have to manually change the Tor connection\noutside of Bitcoin-Qt to create the effect of making the network\nconnections independent.\n\n\n> a.      Does the application ever request balance information for\n> addresses belonging to multiple identities in the same network query?\n>\n\nBlocks are downloaded and tx broadcasts received/relayed rather than\nquerying the utxo set for a particular address. When swapping between\nwallet files, some information may be leaked e.g. the client may be at the\nsame block height in terms of what it has downloaded from the p2p network,\nwhich may leak to global passive adversaries/AS's or sybil attackers the\nfact that a single client was used for multiple wallets.\n\n\n> b.      Are outgoing transactions from multiple identities routed\n> independently of each other to the Bitcoin network?\n>\n\nTransactions from multiple identities would not be routed at the same time.\nI'm not clear what happens if you have a single wallet (identity) open and\nthen open a new wallet (identity) without closing Bitcoin-Qt -- some of the\nsame routing paths may still be used such that an attacker might observe\ntransactions broadast signed by private keys from multiple wallets\n(identities) and observe that they appear to come from the same wallet\nclient. OBPP should assume the worst unless prevented contrary evidence.\n\n\n> c.      When an identity/wallet is deleted, does the deletion process\n> eliminate all evidence from the user's device that the wallet was\n> previously installed?\n>\n\nIdentity is primarily tied to a wallet.dat file. Deleting it will remove\nmost of the evidence that the wallet was installed on that device, but\nthere may be some extra information in ancillary files that should also be\ndeleted.  This is an OS-level function, as there is no operation built into\nthe client to delete a wallet file (identity).\n\n\n>         Network Privacy\n>\n> 10.     When a user performs a backup operation for their wallet, does\n> this generate any automatic network activity, such as a web query or email?\n>\n\nNo. Backups are local, and no email or SMS is linked. No web queries\nrelated to backup.\n\n\n> 11.     Does your application perform any lookup external to the user\u2019s\n> device related to identifying transaction senders or recipients?\n>\n\nNo\n\n\n> 12.     Does you application connect to known endpoints which would be\n> visible to an ISP, such as your domain?\n>\n\nYes, some connections to known p2p full nodes to bootstrap the connection\nto the Bitcoin p2p network. This is configurable, but there are defaults.\nAn ISP is likely to be able to identify a customer as running the\nBitcoin-Qt client in particular on this basis.\n\n\n> 13.     If your application connects directly to nodes in the Bitcoin P2P\n> network, does it either use an unremarkable user agent string (Bitcoin\n> Core.

Mining centralization\nwon't radically change for a 2x adjustment.\n\nSo what would be best for Bitcoin?\n\nI suspect some (if not most of you) would choose b. Because reducing the\nblock interval saves us real time. Waiting 30 minutes for a 3-block\nconfirmation is... such a long time! Time that we value. Time that\nsometimes we waste waiting. Time that makes a difference for us. Doubling\nthe block size does not change the user perception of Bitcoin in any way.\n\nThen why most discussions go around doubling the block size?\n\nEach change require less than 20 lines of code (*) in the reference code,\nand minimum change in other wallets.\n\nCurrently there is no idle mining hardware for hire, so the security of six\n10-minute block confirmation is equivalent to the security of six 5-minute\nblock confirmations, as described in Satoshi's paper (if there were 51%\nspare mining hardware for hire, then obviously hiring that hardware for 30\nminutes would cost less than hiring it for 1 hour).\n\nWhy we discuss a 2x block size increase and not a 1/2 block interval\nreduction? Aren't we Bitcoin users after all?\n\nBest regards,\n Sergio.\n\n(*) b requires increasing the transaction version number, to support the\nold nLockTime rate.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150807/16d23adc/attachment.html>"

It's here\nto stay. Forever. It's a pity Greg chose that awful name of \"SPV\" mining\ninstead some cool name like \"Instant\" mining that we could market as\nBitcoin latest feature :)\n\nDo you consider the TheBlueMatt relay network a \"good thing\". NO! It's a\nvery bad centralization thing, but it is unavoidable. I would like the\nrelay network to be embedded on the standard network protocol, using local\nroute optimizations to reduce latency for block propagation (there is one\nold paper on this, and it says that with local prioritization you can have\na lower bound to get a propagation latency of at most two times the optimal\nvalue (possibly generated by the minimum spanning tree)).\n\nIt requires trust between miners that know eachother, and fundamentally\n> breaks the security assumption of SPV clients...\n>\nNo is does not. The incentive follows directly from the cheating cost (the\nsubsidy). Even if I don't know you, I know you wouldn't waste 25 BTC to try\nto cheat me for 25 BTC with a probability of 1/100, that's for sure. On\naverage, you loose 24.75 BTC per cheat attempt.\n\n\"SPV\" mining is safe as long as it is done for a certain bounded period of\ntime and bounded number of blocks (e.g: 30 seconds from that last validated\nblock, and no more than 1 non-validated block). SPV clients that accept a\ntransaction with 1 confirmation are already in danger of orphaning, and\nlong invalid \"SPV\" mining chain forks (as occurred last month) should never\nhad occurred if limits were in-place.\n\nSPV mining incentive will stay until there is no subsidy, as many other\nincentives. SPV mining also must be there to prevent malicious actors from\nDoS-ing the relay network. If it's there, then the DoS incentive disappears.\n\nLet's code \"instant\" mining into Bitcoin Core, and do it right.\n\nAlso as Michael Rudy points out, higher block rate means lower variance,\nand that's good for miners. Last, as I already said, having a lower average\nblock interval strengthens Bitcoin value proposition, so miners would be\ndelighted that their bitcoins are more worthy.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150810/3e2830e1/attachment-0001.html>"

No other miner would agree to\ndo validation-less mining with them again, making it harder for them to\ncompete.

For people\n> fully happy to trust others with their money, Bitcoin may not be as\n> interesting to them.\n\nI'm making this a thread of its own because this is very serious.\n\nThe idea that Bitcoins very reason for existence is to avoid trusting anyone \nbut yourself is something I've heard before, and I have to comment because it \nis a destructive thought. It is very much untrue because we don't live in a \nblack/white world.\n\nIf you look at the history of money (500 years is enough) you may know about \nbusiness being done in the late 1600s in Europe that included essentially a \ngeneral ledger that every merchant used and had his own copy of (at least \ntheir own bits).\nMerchant in France used a system that when they bought stock from one company\nthey didn't give them money, they instead gave them a IOU-style piece of \npaper.  To break your promise meant to be evicted from their money system.\nWhich to a merchant in that time is equal to starvation.\n\nThe point was NOT to trust no-one, the point was to trust everyone, but keep \neveryone honest by keeping the ledger open and publicly available.\n\n\nBitcoins current model to decentralize and distribute trust has historical \nprecedent and is known to work. It was abandoned when Newton started the mint \nin London because that allowed international trade. And their system didn't \nscale.\n\n\nOn a tangent;\nWhat we saw with the Internet is growth because of a lack of centralized \ncontroller. This does not mean lack of trust in your neighbours. Internet grew \nbecause permissionless innovation was allowed. Not by going from one extreme \nof central trust to the other extreme of no trust.\nIt flourished just by stepping out of the trust-one party extreme.\n\nWhat Adam Black and probably some others must understand is that there is a \nwhole spectrum between having a monopoly on trust and every player having \ntheir own node.\n\nBitcoin sole reason for existence is because it is the first every system that \nhas global reach and does not need a central trusted party.\nIt is, in other words, the first alternative that for the very first time in \ncenturies that allows innovation without permission.\n\n\n> For people\n> fully happy to trust others with their money, Bitcoin may not be as\n> interesting to them.\n\nSo, this is to black/white. And also wrong.\n\nThis thinking will block growth towards the thing you want, and leave you \nwithout any toys at all.\nFor instance it is perfectly all right to have a central player in a poor \ncountry that helps millions of unbanked to use Bitcoin as their first \ninternational payment system.\n\n\nI can only try to convince you to change your worldview be explaining some \nhistory and concepts you may have missed, if you don't thats fine with me. \nI do, however, have to ask you to assume people will not like Bitcoin and will \nnot use it because they don't fit your worldview. That will ultimately hurt \nbillions of people.\n-- \nThomas Zander"

Users need to trust the mining \nsystem is working as intended.  Users also need to trust the developers \nto a certain extent.  It is about levels of trust and how much you need \nto trust these things.

For instance in Amsterdam, one in \nStockholm, etc.\nAnd then propagation of a newly mined block would make the miner only sent the \nheader to this server where a full x-MB block is then created by some \nspecialized software that bases it on the mempool of its bitcoind.\n\nPropagation of a Chinese miner then suddenly doesn't care about blocksize when \nhopping over the chinese firewall. You'd only send a small amount of data, \nlikely around 20Kb for even 8Mb blocks.\n\nA critic would argue its a useless strategy because you'd have to trust the \ndata center operators.\nI'd argue that its a risk, for sure, but one that can be mitigated easily by \nhaving various datacenters around the world where you'd run your software so \nyou'd be able to check the validity of each.\n\nRisks can only be assessed fairly if people are less black/white in their \nthinking.\n\nI love that about Bitcoin, it combines technical specialized thinking with \nEconomics and planning. If you don't have both, you probably end up rejecting \nthe best ideas.\n\n\n> Adam, I think he means a multisig escrow transaction where the escrow\n> is trusted by both parties, and other examples like that.\n\nYes, thats one example. Thanks Jorge!\n\nA similar but relevant example would be like the M-Pesa example.\nPeople that have a phone but not a smart phone can choose to have their \nprivate keys stored at a trusted company in their own country. Some payments \ncan be off-chain, but as soon as you deal with people outside of this small \ncommunity they would be on-chain.\n\nWhen we are talking about remittances, this means one of the two parties does \nnot have an account at the trusted party and as such this will be an on-chain \ntransaction.\nSame for a farmer in Nairobi buying equipment from a company in Cairo, or a \nInternet startup in Kampala/Uganda selling services to users in Europe and \nthose users send their payments on-chain.\n\nAll of these examples are about the largest group of people in the world; the \nunbanked. Bitcoin could mean a huge change to these people and I care a lot \nabout this usecase. We need bigger bocks for these usecases as LN will not do \nanything for them.\n\n-- \nThomas Zander"

This kind of\ndystopia is not, in my view, what the advocates of trustlessness and\nsecurity are implying.\n\nThere are those instances where we have no option other than to trust\na centralized authority. They are mostly self-appointed and do not\nhave the interests of the rest of us in mind. The central bank is the\nobvious example - they impose their currency as \"official\" and then\ndevalue our savings and purchasing power through money supply\ninflation - without our permission and in betrayal of the trust\nrelationship.  Bitcoin allows one to hold money and to conduct money\ntransactions, transmit value, and so forth without having to trust\n*them* - the central bank, or anyone.\n\nIn another example, we want to conduct escrow and have to trust the\nnotary, because of his reputation and framed certificate, but Bitcoin\nmultisig makes the degree of trust between the escrow parties\nirrelevant, so no apparently trustworthy \"gentleman\" merchant (back\nthen or now) can socially engineer a transaction and scam us.\n\nI don't know if my reply and its examples is over-simplistic but it\nseems you were making a moral appeal that the notion of trustlessness\nwas destructive - I just wanted to contextualize it to relevant use\ncases. It follows, and this is what I understand from Adam's message,\nthat security and protection of decentralization are paramount\nconcerns if we want to retain the trustlessness that makes Bitcoin so\nuseful and powerful.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1\n\niQEcBAEBAgAGBQJVxcZSAAoJEGwAhlQc8H1mmAUH/RprBA/tz13/CIJTQ4HHYU5v\nkBAyirwhkx5NEvovFGV40PNpIE7OLqfoN2ThpwJSO8fqnPwbcGEr1qvZAaN9A68y\nGD1sjw2y+8+hQUtrikMurBFzCX4msBvfYNPHX4J7SBR9qdxC9L7p6HaY5fvdwpQW\nDmUMidKuRPpWH5AL9DqB9ZwHtPZ8mVaJGHMw1aI9QV0cTlq49ktbt/246wAjtRkb\nMyw2c9hKT2WIwzmWcruokSXJ4yza6DGYKrcyzprIDCJFEj29geoIderyU+0qzRQ7\njulB3Ft05xp2F6LheeH40wa7iyeRs6LWRNr2qElutu6Ta7Rvlg5ZCUGN52SGQtY=\n=3rcg\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

In one meaning trust is an\n(well founded) expectation of faithful behavior.  In another it is a\nblind reliance.   When \"trust everyone\" is used, it's speaking to the\nfirst definition, when the trustless definition is used it's referring\nto the second defintion-- without blind faith.\n\nA trustless (second def) system allows its users to trust (first def)\neveryone, even the inherently untrustworthy (second def).  In doing\nso, the considerable cost and inequality created by the maintaince of\ntrust (second definition) relations is mitigated, and the availablity\nof faithful performance increased.  Doing so is a prerequsite to\nhaving a strongly decenteralized system, because otherwise trust\nrequiremets drive the enviroment towards natural monopolies (as it's\ncheaper and more effective for more people to trust (second def) a\nsmaller number of parties.\n\nLess philosophically, if you're willing to have systems defined by\ntrust (first definition) (e.g. you do not believe that what I descibed\nabove coveys value, or hope that witl a small number of very trusted\nparties external factors will transform blind faith into a rational\nexpectation of faithful performance) then there are _much_ more\ntechnically superior ways to structure a system than Bitcoin does\ntoday-- ones that acheive much greater performance, flexibility,\nreliablity, and better security (ignoring any insecurity that arises\nas a result of the trusted parties strong assumptions).\n\nIf one wants to layer trust based things on top of a trust mitigating\nframework, they can do so-- and enjoy efficiencies from doing so.\nDoing the converse doesn't appear really possible."

However, opening and closing channels will not\nbe infrequent to the point that it will never happen with Lightning.\nIndividuals that fill up their channel will need to accommodate\naccumulation (as well as those that do a lot of disbursement). These\nfund flows are not too rare, and huge payments (think the equivalent to\nwire transfers today) will probably be still on-chain. I think the\npayment size of micropayments to credit cards are Lightning-scale, what\npeople use today for wire transfers (e.g. buying a house) will be\non-chain.\n\nWhat Lightning does is it mitigates the advantages that doing an end-run\naround bitcoin entirely via centralized systems provides to a sufficient\nlevel, e.g. everyone transacting on Coinbase. Having everything on\ncentralized services will have significantly lower on-chain transactions\nthan Lightning and is one of the more viable alternative off-chain\npayments.\n\nFundamentally, without off-chain transactions, there's a paradox within\na viable fee market. If you presume that fees should be relatively\ncompetitive (i.e. not asymptotically close to zero), that implies that\nhigher-value transactions *will* be prioritized over low-value\ntransactions, as high-value transactions are willing to pay higher fees.\nWire transfers are cheap when it's a million-dollar wire.\n\nIn my view, different transaction values is the much larger risk for\non-chain transaction fee markets, with high-value transactions crowding\nout low-value transactions on-chain. With lightning, it significantly\nmitigates this problem by aggregating the low-value transactions\noff-chain.\n\n-- \nJoseph Poon"

If bitcoin's price rises at just 19% pa on average (which doesn't\nseem like much if you're thinking in startup/VC terms?), then the block\nreward will still be worth about $475k/day after it halves again to 6.25\ncoins per block. So maybe the block reward pays for bitcoin transactions\nand fees are effectively zero right up until the day the block reward\ngoes away entirely?\n\nIn any event, the lightning network offers three potential benefits over\non-chain transactions:\n\n - lower fees\n - shorter confirmation times\n - no ongoing costs once the channel is closed\n\nIf you have zero fees, lightning is still interesting for quick\ntransactions (since they offer better assurance of payment than\nzero-confirmation transactions), and also for microtransactions (where\nspamming the blockchain and the UTXO db with thousands of transactions\njust to move $1 from here to there isn't appealing).\n\n> Off-chain transactions, whether it's Lightning or something else,\n> potentially extract fees, which may otherwise be paid to miners, if the\n> transactions were actually on-chain.\n\nEvery lightning transaction happens through a series of channels (at least\none, but realistically at least two; with any amount of decentralisation,\nprobably more likely somewhere in the range of three to twenty). Each\nof those channels requires at least two blockchain transactions (one or\ntwo to create the channel; one or three to close the channel and spend\nthe balances).\n\nIt's not 100% clear at this point, but keeping a lightning channel open\nwill probably have (hardware) costs that grow linearly in the number of\ntransactions [0]; in which case keeping them open forever won't be an\noption, and they'll be closed when the cost of keeping it open is less\nthan the cost of resetting it on the blockchain (only one blockchain\ntransaction required). So in that case even if lightning is crazy popular,\nthere'll still be activity on the blockchain at whatever fee rate there\nis, just by people trading off storage costs for blockchain fees.\n\n[0] http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-July/000057.html\n\nEven if it's not the case, closing a channel eventually is probably\ngood practice in order to rollover keys. Channels also have a maximum\ntheoretical number of transactions, but that's likely on the order\nof exa-transactions, so is probably irrelevant. Channel profitability\nlikely varies over time, and since channels lock up bitcoin, closing\nless profitable channels so the funds can be used elsewhere is likely\nalso valuable. \n\nWith all those things together, ballpark max lifetime of a random channel\n(IMHO) is somewhere in the range of two weeks to two years. If lightning\nis the only thing doing transactions on the blockchain and only using\n250B/txn, 8M channels with an average lifetime of 2 weeks would fill\n1MB blocks; as would 210M channels with an average lifetime of a year,\nor 420M channels with an average lifetime of two years. Those sort\nof numbers probably roughly cover lots of Americans having access to\na lightning based point-of-sale network to buy Starbucks, eg, but not\nmuch more than that. (You need at least one channel per customer, plus\none per business, plus something on the order of log(N) hubs to connect\nthem all; having multiple channels is probably about as good an idea as\nhaving multiple credit cards).\n\n> In this context, wouldn't it be contradictory, maybe even harmful, to\n> aim for an environment, where some/many/most transactions are off-chain?\n\nLightning transactions will have to pay for several things:\n\n - the blockchain fees for opening/closing the channel\n - the time value of the funds being used to keep the channels open,\n   for each channel in the route from payer to payee\n - the maintenance costs of the hardware/software to run a lightning\n   channel\n\nBy contrast, blockchain transactions just have to pay miners the\nblockchain fee for the transaction; there's no other intermediaries\nwho have to be compensated. At some point, the latter will certainly\nbe cheaper than the former -- since the lightning network has to pay\nfor third parties' time value of bitcoin there should certainly be some\n\"sufficiently large\" amount whose time value is higher than the bitcoin\ntxn fee, even for a very short txn time.\n\nIt's all a bit hypothetical though -- not only is lightning still\nunimplemented as yet, but I think at present the time value of bitcoin is\neffectively zero (ie, afaik people recommend \"just buy and hold bitcoin\nand wait for the next bubble\", rather than \"buy bitcoin and put it in\nAwesomeBank's Term Deposit product and gain 3% pa\"), and most of the\ntime fees seem to be basically zero too.\n\nI think the general answer is that lightning relies on the blockchain --\nif the blockchain doesn't work, neither does lightning. So whatever level\nof txn fees it takes to make the blockchain work; whether that's $0/txn,\n1c/txn or $50/txn, nodes in the lightning network will pay that fee,\nand, presumably, pass it on to the lightning network's end users in the\nform of txn fees on the lightning network.\n\nCheers,\naj"

                "message_text_only": "Hi Anthony,\n\nNo belief can be shown to be universally held, and an appeal to\nauthority is also a logical fallacy for good reason.\n\nThe blog you quote is littered with flawed economic ideas. It's become a\npet peeve of mine that people refer to mining (and/or validation) as a\n\"tragedy of the commons\" problem, or a \"public good\" subject to a \"free\nrider\" problem. This betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of both\nmoney and Bitcoin.\n\nI'm not commenting on the other merits of your argument or others in\nthis thread, I mean just to dispute the validity of this particular\nreference. Even the portion you quoted is quite absurd:\n\n>> \"We\u2019re not spending so much on mining because we really need it.\n>> It\u2019s because printing money distorts behaviour.\"\n\nWe don't \"really need\" to prevent \"printing money\" - Bitcoin could\nsomehow get by without that constraint? Preventing the printing of money\nis the only reason that Bitcoin exists.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons scenario properly applies only to property\ncontrolled by the state. In the quoted blog the analogy is so misapplied\nthat it fundamentally misrepresents the forces at work in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is not at all \"like a lighthouse\". State run lighthouses are\nfinanced via taxation. That may be taxation of anything, whether or not\nrelated to the shipping the lighthouse purports to protect. It may in\nfact protect no shipping at all, since payment is generally completely\ndivorced from benefit, and the benefits may be completely divorced from\nshipping. For example, preservation of jobs for lighthouse keepers and\nthe Coast Guard, or even nostalgia. Just as with a private grazing\nfield, a truly private lighthouse would not have a \"commons problem\" at all.\n\nBitcoin mining is financed by a fixed schedule of inflation and\ntransaction fees. State inflation is a tax on all holders of currency\nand a form of default on state debt. This and other taxes fund\nlighthouses. A tax is the seizure of someone else's property through\nforce. Bitcoin inflation is predictable, so the inflation cost is\nfactored in to its value before it is acquired, according to the\ndepreciation schedule, just like bond valuation for example. This means\nit is NOT a tax, is merely a cost that is paid to miners for use of\ntheir security services.\n\nBitcoin transaction \"fees\" are not fees in the state use-fee (taxation)\nsense, since the fees are priced based on voluntary trade. The blog\nmisinterprets who is paying the cost of securing a transaction when it\nclaims, \"it's the sender who pays.\" Both parties to a transaction bear\nthe cost of using any given medium of exchange. If the receiver is\nconcerned about double spending risk, it's the sender who will have to\ncompensate with time and/or money. But this is just as much a cost to\nthe receiver as it has raised the effective price of his sales with the\ndifference in money accruing to the third party.\n\nFinally, transaction fees *are* mining contracts. Creating *another*\nsystem of mining contracts initiated by a receiver would do nothing to\nchange the economics, but it would significantly complicate the\nimplementation (raising costs generally). The cost of paying a mining\ncontract would of course be paid by the sender, in terms of increased\nprice charged by the receiver.\n\nI believe that a fundamental misunderstanding of the important\ndistinction between voluntary trade and state-controlled trade is\nunderpinning a lot of confusion and misunderstanding with respect to the\nblock size debate. Bitcoin does not have a commons problem specifically\nbecause it's designed to resist state control. It's only in the loss of\nthat independence that such a problem would arise (and effectively kill\nBitcoin altogether).\n\nIronically the desire to fix a non-existent commons problem in Bitcoin\nseems to be a driving force behind what may in fact weaken its only\ndefence against eventually becoming a commons.\n\ne\n\n\nOn 08/10/2015 11:50 AM, Anthony Towns via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n> On Mon, Aug 10, 2015 at 12:20:36AM +0200, info--- via bitcoin-dev wrote:\n>> one argument I often read on this mailing list is that it's essential to\n>> reward miners with transaction fees at some point to secure the network.\n> \n> That's not a universally held belief.

But who can run a full node (see above)? How is\nthe channel secured (against MITM, privacy) between the SPV client and\nthe trusted full node? How hard is it to setup and maintain a secure\ntunnel between a smartphone SPV and a full node over the p2p (8333)\nchannel? How about examine the mempool for fee calculations and\n(maybe) upcoming CPFP like approaches, etc.?\n\nHow about smartphones?\nObviously the above solution won\u2019t probably work on a smartphone (to\nmuch bandwidth and CPU usage). But do you carry your whole saving in\nyour physical wallet with you? Maybe a smartphone does hold keys which\nprotects low value / daily spendings like a physical wallet (=SPV okay).\nMy personal long term vision of that use-case is, that groups of\npeople who trust each other (a family, etc.) might run one or multiple\nfull node(s) on a hardened system (something similar to the bitnodes\nhardware) where the system could serve smartphones over something like\na stratum server (electrum) or bitpays wallet-service does (index\nblockchain, additional wallet services). Every member still holds it\u2019s\nkeys but they trust the connected full node (full nodes does address\nindex, balance calculation, multisig arrangements and maybe even coin\nselection).\n\nSince about one year i slowly work toward this direction. It took me a\nwhile to commit myself to a strategy (and i still shake from time to\ntime).\nAt the moment I am working on a wallet focused bitcoin-core fork with\nthe ability to re-merge it to the bitcoin-core branch (keep the fork\nrebased).\nLong term goal is, to decouple the both (wallet / core) by using\nbitcoin-core as a library (static or shared) for the wallet side\n(which is possible already now)\n\nTo myself: I work in the bitcoin-space full-time and completely\nindependent (not employed or influenced by a bitcoin related company)\nwith no business interest, though, i think the acquired know-how can\nbe valuable within the next serval years. And i won\u2019t have any regrets\nif my work turns out to be unless and ends up in trash.\n\nI have set up this mail to avoid parallelism on a works stream (if\nthere is any). Of course i would really appreciate if other developers\nare willing to join the team by reviewing, concept critism or\ncontributing code at https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin.\n\nAny forms of criticism and any ideas are highly appreciated.\n\n\n\u2014\n/jonas\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v2\n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\nOwxleWQP0eC/5knZSFwB\n=7CG9\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

                "message_text_only": "Hey Jonas,\n\nI think your analysis of what (some) users need is a good one.\n\nWe've discussed this before so I know you prefer your current approach, but\nI personally would take a slightly different path to reach the same end:\n\n   1. Support serving of SPV wallets from pruned storage. This means some\n   protocol upgrades, BIPs, etc. It helps all SPV wallets, including on phones.\n   2. Then make a bitcoinj based desktop wallet app, that contains a\n   bundled bitcoind.\n   3. Make the app sync TWO wallets simultaneously, one from the P2P\n   network as today, and another from the local bitcoind via a local socket\n   (or even just passing buffers around internally)\n   4. The app should then switch from using the wallet synced to P2P to the\n   wallet synced to localhost when the latter is fully caught up, and back\n   again when the local node is behind.\n   5. If there's a discrepancy, alert the user.\n\nThere are big advantages of taking this path! They are:\n\n   - The switching back and forth between local full-security mode (which\n   may be behind) and remote SPV security (fully synced) is instant and\n   transparent to the user. This is important for laptop users who don't run a\n   local node all the time. The different audit levels can be reflected in the\n   UI in some way.\n\n   - The bitcoinj wallet code already has support for things like\n   multi-sig, BIP32, seed words, micropayment channels, etc. You can disable\n   Bloom filtering if you like (download full blocks).\n\n   - You can do a local RPC or JNI/JNA call to get fee estimates, if wanted.\n\n   - The modern JVM tools and languages are much, much more productive than\n   working with C++.\n\n\nIf you want a thing that runs a home server, then the best way to do that\nIMO would be to bundle Tor and make it auto-register a Tor hidden service.\nThen you can just define a QR code standard for 'pairing' a wallet to a\n.onion address. Any bitcoinj based wallet can sync to it, and as it's your\nown node, you can use a Bloom filter sized to give virtually no false\npositives. No additional indexing is then required.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150811/87594257/attachment.html>"

High fees do the following:\n\n-Reduce the utility of people using the network, even if the higher fees\ndon't reduce their amount of transactions.\n-Make some use cases nonviable, depriving people of Bitcoin's decentralized\nbenefits.\n-Makes level 2 infrastructure like Lightning less valuable by increasing\nthe minimum value of anchor txns that make sense, and increasing the amount\nof pain suffered when your counterparty misbehaves.\n-Discourage experimentation with new Bitcoin use cases, making it more\nunlikely that such cases are discovered/improved/popular before Bitcoin's\nsecurity relies on having many users.\n-Makes Bitcoin more vulnerable to regulation by keeping its user base from\ngrowing, meaning regulators face less pressure to keep it unregulated (see:\nUber)\n-Reduce the amount of time we have between now and when tx fees need to pay\nfor a significant portion of Bitcoin's security, by keeping the exchange\nrate and thus the value of block rewards low (\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange)\n-By slowing usage growth, make it less likely that we have a large enough\nbase of transactions by the time we need to fund network security via tx\nfees.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150812/486116ac/attachment-0001.html>"

If I'm a user who is used to making txns for\n1 cent each and suddenly all my txns cost 1 dollar each. then the benefit I\nget for each of my transactions that I still make is reduced by 99 cents\nper tx. This is as concrete a negative effect as I can imagine. It might\nseem obvious that this is a cost, but it seems to be ignored by a lot of\nparticipants.\n\n\n\n> > -Make some use cases nonviable, depriving people of Bitcoin's\n> decentralized\n> > benefits.\n>\n> It is clear that not all use cases fit the blockchain, but it's still\n> unclear which ones don't fit yet.\n> But the amount of use cases supported is not a valid metric for\n> decentralization.\n>\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"valid metric for decentralization.\" I thought\nthe goal here was to list all negative consequences of high fees. Not just\nconsequences to decentralization. We're trying to figure out how to trade\noff risks to decentralization against these other things we're listing\nwhich aren't necessarily about decentralization (such as reduced use cases).\n\n\n> In any case, it would be interesting if we could list some concrete\n> cases that would be lost.\n>\n\nIf tx fees rise to $1, then I'll stop making on-blockchain purchases of\nless than about $100, meaning pretty much all retail purchases are\neliminated. It's hard to list a lot of use cases that will be lost because\nBitcoin usage is very low right now. I assume most of us believe that there\nare lots of interesting use cases that have not developed yet. Just because\nthey don't exist now doesn't mean we should ignore the fact that high fees\nmight make them nonviable.\n\nSome examples of stuff that doesn't exist now but might be prevented or\nsignificantly harmed by high fees: small international remittances, machine\nto machine payments, decentralized prediction markets (maybe people like\nmaking lots of small bets). Just take any potential use case you can think\nof: if the per-tx benefit to the person is less than $1, then $1 tx fees\nwill prevent it. See below for another example.\n\n\n> > -Discourage experimentation with new Bitcoin use cases, making it more\n> > unlikely that such cases are discovered/improved/popular before Bitcoin's\n> > security relies on having many users.\n>\n> Experimentation can be done with worthless testchains.

So much of\nexperimentation can't be done on a testchain, because most experiments that\nare being done by early stage companies are about product market fit, and\nwhich services are valuable to users.\n\nLet's say that you and I start a company that allows people to charge money\nto people who want to email/message them. There are so many things that we\nneed to figure out that can't be figured out without participating in the\nactual market, with real people, who are really trying to use our service.\nIt might take us years of making little tweaks to the product before we hit\non some solution that people finally like enough to use in large numbers.\n\nLet's say that right now tx fees are $1, and imagine that the highest\namount that most people are willing to pay to email people is 25 cents. If\nwe are experimenting in a market with $1 tx fees, perhaps our company will\njust die and we'll never figure out how to bring people this service that\nthey want. Perhaps there are a lot of other innovations relating to 'pay to\nmessage' that would have otherwise been developed (maybe celebrities like\ndoing AMAs via pay-to-message and devote the funds to charities. Maybe this\nbecomes a huge source of charitable giving in the future), but because\nBitcoin's high fee environment didn't allow us to explore these ideas, this\nwhole service category goes undeveloped for many years.\n\n> -Reduce the amount of time we have between now and when tx fees need to\n> pay\n> > for a significant portion of Bitcoin's security, by keeping the exchange\n> > rate and thus the value of block rewards low\n> > (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange)\n>\n> Related to exchange rate.\n>\n\nElsewhere you write \"I believe 'fear of exchange rate declining' can\nprobably be added to any concern/risk 'leaf', so we should probably leave\nthat for the end or just omit it.\"\n\nIt's true that you could tell some indirect story about how pretty much\nanything could affect the exchange rate, but separate from all the\nhypothetical stories there is a strong theoretical reason to believe that\nthe exchange rate will be higher the more value is transacted in the\nBitcoin ecosystem. See the wiki link on the equation of exchange. More\npeople using Bitcoin for transactions will drive up the price, all else\nbeing equal. Perhaps many people care about the price for irrelevant\nreasons (they just want to be rich), but as long as Bitcoin's security is\ntied to the exchange rate via block rewards, it's also an important\nconsideration for security.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150815/99104c9c/attachment.html>"

If they choose to delay including transactions proportional to their fee + first seen, then you create a time based fee market. Want quick confirmation? Pay a high fee. Don\u2019t care that much? Pay a low fee (and anywhere in between). This market would work just fine even if block capacity was unbounded.\n\njp\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 842 bytes\nDesc: Message signed with OpenPGP using GPGMail\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150813/9b9afe12/attachment.sig>"

                "message_text_only": "I have written the following draft BIP for a new opcode\nCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY by Mark Friedenbach, which introduces a form of\nrelative-locktime to Bitcoin's scripting language.\n\nhttps://github.com/btcdrak/bips/blob/bip-checksequenceverify/bip-csv.mediawiki\n\n<pre>\n  BIP: XX\n  Title: CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\n  Authors: BtcDrak <btcdrak at gmail.com>\n           Mark Friedenbach <mark at friedenbach.org>\n  Status: Draft\n  Type: Standards Track\n  Created: 2015-08-10\n</pre>\n\n==Abstract==\n\nThis BIP describes a new opcode (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) for the Bitcoin\nscripting system that in combination with BIP 68 allows execution\npathways of a script to be restricted based on the age of the output\nbeing spent.\n\n\n==Summary==\n\nCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY redefines the existing NOP3 opcode. When executed\nit compares the top item on the stack to the inverse of the nSequence\nfield of the transaction input containing the scriptSig. If the\ninverse of nSequence is less than the sequence threshold (1 << 31),\nthe transaction version is greater than or equal to 2, and the top\nitem on the stack is less than or equal to the inverted nSequence,\nscript evaluation continues as though a NOP was executed. Otherwise\nthe script fails immediately.\n\nBIP 68's redefinition of nSequence prevents a non-final transaction\nfrom being selected for inclusion in a block until the corresponding\ninput has reached the specified age, as measured in block heiht or\nblock time. By comparing the argument to CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY against\nthe nSequence field, we indirectly verify a desired minimum age of the\nthe output being spent; until that relative age has been reached any\nscript execution pathway including the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY will fail\nto validate, causing the transaction not to be selected for inclusion\nin a block.\n\n\n==Motivation==\n\nBIP 68 repurposes the transaction nSequence field meaning by giving\nsequence numbers new consensus-enforced semantics as a relative\nlock-time.

This auxillary blockheight is only used for\naccounting in timestopped height computation (and isn't used for\nanything else). So as the real blockheight increments, the auxillary\nblockheight can sometimes stop and stay the same. If a transaction has a\ntimestop bit enabled, then the transaction's OP_CSV relative height is\ndependent upon the auxillary height, not the real block height. This\nallows for a large backlog of transactions which must occur before a\nparticular (relative) block height to enter into the blockchain.\n\nI'm not sure if it's out of scope, but it could make sense to consider\nthe possibility for additional state(s) with relative height computation\ntoday. Ideally, there'd be some kind of \"version\" byte which can be\nrecontextualized into something later, but I don't know how that could\ncleanly fit into the data structure/code.\n\n-- \nJoseph Poon"

Normally a lightning user\nis protected form such behavior because they have time to broadcast their\nown transactions spending part or all of the balance as fees. Therefore\nbecause of the threat of mutually assured destruction, the optimal outcome\nis to be an honest participant.\n\nBut, the argument goes, the hub has many channels with many different\npeople closing at the same time. So if the hub tries to cheat all of them\nat once by DoS'ing the network, it can do so and spend more in fees than\nany one participant stands to lose. My issue with this is that users don't\nact alone -- users can be assured that other users will react, and all of\nthem together have enough coins to burn to make the attack unprofitable.\nThe hub-cheats-many-users case really is the same as the\nhub-cheats-one-user case if the users act out their role in unison, which\nthey don't have to coordinate to do.\n\nOther than that, even if you are still concerned about that  scenario, I'm\nnot sure timestop is the appropriate solution. A timestop is a\nprotocol-level complication that is not trivial to implement, indeed I'm\nnot even sure there is a way to implement it at all -- how do you\ndifferentiate in consensus code a DoS attack from regular old blocks\nfilling up? And if you could, why add further complication to the consensus\nprotocol?\n\nA simpler solution to me seems to be outsourcing the response to an attack\nto a third party, or otherwise engineering ways for users to\nrespond-by-default even if their wallet is offline, or otherwise assuring\nsufficient coordination in the event of a bad hub.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150813/a161abd7/attachment.html>"

                "message_text_only": "Hmm\u2026 well, yes and no. Mostly no :)\n\nThe main idea i was trying to describe was that the actual difficulty for the block could be adjusted according to how much the size of the proposed block differ compared to the average size of blocks in the previous difficulty period. Unless I\u2019m being very dense atm your gist is just about dynamically adjusting the blocksize?\n\n\n I\u2019ll give a numeric example to clarify a bit.\n\nAssume the current difficulty was calculated to be 1000, and the average size of the blocks in the period used to calculate the difficulty was 500kb.\nExample 1:\nI\u2019m now attempting to find a new block with a size of 450 kb, or 450/500 = 10% smaller than average. The difficulty would then be 1000 * 110% = 1100\nExample 2:\nIf I instead was trying to make a block sized 10000 kb, or 10000/500 = 2000% bigger than average the difficulty would be adjusted to 1000*20 = 20000\n\n\nWhy I find this interesting is in a possible future when the block reward is insignificant compared to the transactions fees miners would make bigger blocks as fees rise. A miner could include more transactions into blocks as long as the fees are high enough to offset the reduced chance of actually finding the block. However, I now realize that there wouldn\u2019t be any downward pressure below the average size if the price shrinks (using the particular numbers i have in my examples) though. Maybe this method is only useful on the upside of the blocks, meaning blocks smaller than the average size doesn\u2019t get adjusted difficulty. I need to go for a walk and think this through :)\n\n\n> 14 aug 2015 kl. 15:32 skrev Angel Leon <gubatron at gmail.com>:\n> \n> Like this?\n> https://gist.github.com/gubatron/143e431ee01158f27db4 <https://gist.github.com/gubatron/143e431ee01158f27db4>\n> \n> http://twitter.com/gubatron <http://twitter.com/gubatron>\n> \n> On Fri, Aug 14, 2015 at 5:59 AM, Jakob R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org <mailto:bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>> wrote:\n> Greetings,\n> \n> a thought occurred to me that I would love to hear what some bitcoin experts think about.\n> \n> What if one were to adjust the difficulty (for individual blocks) depending on the relative size to the average block size of the previous difficulty period?

It's subtle and\nlikely rare in the real-world, though obviously not impossible given\nthe report here. For posterity, here's a rundown (braindump) of the\nissue.\n\nWhen calling EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(), openssl internally checks to\nsee how to setup the curve's EC_METHOD (simple, montgomery, or nist).\n\nUnfortunately, in all released OpenSSL versions (as far as I can tell\nmaster is the only branch that has fixed this issue), it's tested like\nso:\n\n- Try a method. If it fails, set a global error and return.\n- If the global error is set, try a different method.\n\nPrior to OpenSSL 1.0.0, these were tested in the order:\nEC_GFp_nist_method -> EC_GFp_mont_method. The secp256k1 curve fails\nthe ec_GFp_nist_group_set_curve test and sets the global error. That\nerror is then checked for failure, and EC_GFp_mont_method is tried\n(and succeeds).\n\nObviously that global error usage is dangerous, especially since it\nhappens for _each_ transaction verification in libbitcoinconsensus. In\na multi-threaded environment, a crash is guaranteed within a few\nseconds.\n\nHowever, OpenSSL 1.0.1 reversed the order, trying EC_GFp_mont_method\nfirst, so that the global error doesn't end up being used:\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/17674bfdf75bffa4e225f8328b9d42cb74504005\n\nThis was backported from master back to 1.0.1, but not to 1.0.0 or 0.9.8.\n\nSo that change (accidentally) \"solved\" the problem. As you can see,\nit's still possible to hit the reversed order in the\n!defined(OPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT) case. That's easily tested by building\nOpenSSL with the -no-asm config option. It's probably also the case\nfor obscure architectures and OSs, but I haven't looked deeply into\nthat. In that case, it's reasonable to assume that this crash would\nlikely occur on such platforms.\n\nAlso, OSX, even the latest version (10.10 as of now), still ships with\nOpenSSL 0.9.8. Which is how Tamas ran into it.\n\nSince Bitcoin Core and libbitcoinconsensus are switching away from\nOpenSSL for verification in the near future, I don't think this is\nmuch of an issue. Especially since the problem manifests as a\ncontrolled assertion failure/abort. However, I've prepared a patch for\nanyone who may run into the issue in the short-term:\nhttps://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/adf0a691ee1c2f02e26828f976cfe5b78896b507\n\nI'll open a pull-request for Bitcoin Core to discuss whether it's\nworth merging or not.\n\nRegards,\nCory\n\nOn Fri, Aug 14, 2015 at 5:10 PM, Cory Fields <lists at coryfields.com> wrote:\n> Ugh, what an unfortunate oversight!\n>\n> The good news is that this issue should be solved in future versions\n> when we switch to the new libsecp256k1 lib for validation.\n>\n> For now, I've thrown together a quick hack to allow a user-specifiable\n> callback for libbitcoinconsensus.

                "message_text_only": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI'd like to propose a new set of requirements as a policy on when to accept\nnew transactions into the mempool and relay them.  This policy would affect\ntransactions which have as inputs other transactions which are not yet\nconfirmed in the blockchain.\n\nThe motivation for this policy is 6470\n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6470> which aims to limit the size\nof a mempool.  As discussed in that pull\n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6470#issuecomment-125324736>, once\nthe mempool is full a new transaction must be able to pay not only for the\ntransaction it would evict, but any dependent transactions that would be\nremoved from the mempool as well.  In order to make sure this is always\nfeasible, I'm proposing 4 new policy limits.\n\nAll limits are command line configurable.\n\nThe first two limits are required to make sure no chain of transactions\nwill be too large for the eviction code to handle:\n\nMax number of descendant txs : No transaction shall be accepted if it would\ncause another transaction in the mempool to have too many descendant\ntransactions (all of which would have to be evicted if the ancestor\ntransaction was evicted).  Default: 1000\n\nMax descendant size : No transaction shall be accepted if it would cause\nanother transaction in the mempool to have the total size of all its\ndescendant transactions be too great.  Default : maxmempool / 200  =  2.5MB\n\nThe third limit is required to make sure calculating the state required for\nsorting and limiting the mempool and enforcing the first 2 limits is\ncomputationally feasible:\n\nMax number of ancestor txs:  No transaction shall be accepted if it has too\nmany ancestor transactions which are not yet confirmed (ie, in the\nmempool). Default: 100\n\nThe fourth limit is required to maintain the pre existing policy goal that\nall transactions in the mempool should be mineable in the next block.\n\nMax ancestor size: No transaction shall be accepted if the total size of\nall its unconfirmed ancestor transactions is too large.  Default: 1MB\n\n(All limits include the transaction itself.)\n\nFor reference, these limits would have affected less than 2% of\ntransactions entering the mempool in April or May of this year.  During the\nperiod of 7/6 through 7/14, while the network was under stress test, as\nmany as 25% of the transactions would have been affected.\n\nThe code to implement the descendant package tracking and new policy limits\ncan be found in 6557 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6557> which\nis built off of 6470.\n\nThanks,\nAlex\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150814/3ee1bf86/attachment.html>"

Let me try and explain why it's done this way.\n\n*In theory*, you do have a vote. If a majority of miners were to club\ntogether and decide to change the protocol against the wishes of the wider\nuser base, then we'd get a fight between the hashpower majority and the\nso-called economic majority. And because bitcoins only have value because\nyou can buy things with them, in theory, the wishes of the economic\nmajority should always win.\n\n*In practice*, the code we have today doesn't let us measure what the\neconomic majority wants. It's not even really clear how that term is\ndefined. Intuitively we can understand that people who are trading real\ngoods and services for bitcoin have the final say, because they can always\njust refuse to accept BTC. But defining it precisely enough to put in an\nalgorithm is tricky.\n\nThen you have the question of how to express the vote? For miners, it's\neasy: they express their vote by switching to a different full node\nimplementation that gives them different blocks.\n\nFor users, it'd mean switching to a different wallet. If their wallet is\nfully validating and the decision is implemented via hard fork, this is\nsufficient. If the wallet is *not* fully validating and cannot detect the\nfork point by itself, then it'd need help in the form of checkpointing.\nSome months ago I pointed out this possibility and a whole bunch of people\nfreaked out - then bitcoin.org decided to start censoring any wallet that\nsaid it'd ignore what miners wanted.\n\nSo if you want a user vote, that's an issue that'd have to be tackled: the\npeople who admin the main communication channels Bitcoin users have vowed\nto censor any program that doesn't slavishly follow 51%+ hash power. That\nattempt to control the conversation is certainly not libertarian or\ndemocratic in nature, but there you go.\n\nWe can also imagine voting via proof-of-stake. This might be useful as a\nform of opinion poll, but wallet developers would have to actually add\nsupport for such a protocol to their apps, and then we're back to the same\nissue as with mining pools. Plus, of course, static wealth does not equal\neconomic importance.\n\nLuckily the wallet market is a decentralisation success story. There are\nwallets everywhere these days. Man+dog make their own wallet, it seems. So\nit's not silly to think a coin voting protocol could one day happen.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150815/feb8df3a/attachment.html>"

Some people have claimed for years \nthat Bitcoin development is \"decentralized\" because anyone can fork the \ncode.  I have often pointed out to them that such a process is not \ndecentralization similar to the process of Bitcoin mining.  It is \nprobably closer to checks and balances you see in political systems. The \nresponse is usually that I am \"troll\" or that I am somehow attacking the \ndevelopers by simply describing the system.  The result is that the \nissues and risks associated with development are often not properly \nevaluated.  It is the same sorts of problems you have when a central \nbank or Fed is controlled by a small group.  It is just human nature and \nBitcoin is not immune.\n\nRuss"

Personally, I'd love to see a vote from\nthe core and XT developers on:\n\n - what should the block size soft limit be in 12 months (min and max)\n - what should the block size hard limit be in 12 months (min and max)\n\n - at what rate should the hard limit grow over the next 10 years\u200b (min and\nmax)\n\n - what mechanism should be used to update the soft limit\n   (manual code change, time based, blockchain history, something else)\n\u200b - what me\u200bchanism should be used to update the hard limit\n   (hard fork code change, time based, blockchain history, something else)\n\nBonus:\n\n\u200b - what should the\n\u200btransaction \u200b\nfee level be in 12 months (after the reward halves)?\u200b\n - what's a good measure of \"(de)centralisation\" and what value should\neveryone aim for in 12 months?\n\nAs an interested newbie, I can't actually tell what most people think the\nanswers to most of those questions are. FWIW, mine would be:\n\n - soft limit in 12 months: 1MB-4MB\n - hard limit in 12 months: 2MB-20MB\n - hard limit grows at 17-40% a year (and should be >4x average txn volume)\n - update the soft limit by code changes or blockchain history\n - update the hardlimit by (1) fee level, (2) miner vote, (3) hard coded\ntime updates at a conservative (low) rate, (4) hard fork every couple of\nyears\n - transaction fees should in 12months should be lower per kB than today's\ndefaults, say 20%-50% of today's defaults in USD\n - number of bitcoin nodes, should be 20% higher in 12 months than it is now\n\n\u200bCheers,\naj\n\n-- \nAnthony Towns <aj at erisian.com.au>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150816/cc92c904/attachment.html>"

                "message_text_only": "[cross-posted to libbitcoin]\n\nI applaud this effort not for the merits of the hard fork but on the\neffects of the code fork. We have been witnessing the self-destruction\nof Bitcoin's central authority. This is a necessary outcome.\n\nUnderstandably, many are concerned that if consensus settles on a larger\nblock size Bitcoin will suffer greater centralization. The point of\nBitcoin however is that nobody is in control of consensus. If a\nconsensus decision leads to centralization, the consensus will move.\n\nYes, when this happens people who bet on the losing fork will lose\nmoney. This is how Bitcoin works. One bets not on personal desires but\non what others will accept. That is how consensus is built.\n\nSome fret that if this process evolves Bitcoin will suffer a\ncatastrophic loss of \"value\" and not recover. This may come to pass, but\nthere is no avoiding the possibility.\n\nThe ease with which consensus can move when it wants to is important. In\nother words, friction is weakness and a single overly complex codebase\nis high friction.\n\nAmir saw this coming before most. While we are posting manifestos, I\nthought it more than appropriate to quote from the libbitcoin manifesto:\n\n> If development is too centralised, with a small core infrastructure,\n> then businesses will put real pressure to have features that destroy\n> the integrity of the Bitcoin network.\n> ...\n> The possible malicious scenarios are endless....At the other end of\n> the spectrum, is putting development effort into diversifying the\n> ecosystem to protect against censorship... That's where developers\n> who believe in Bitcoin should devote time to.\n> ...\n> A diversified Bitcoin of many wallets and implementations is a strong\n> and pure Bitcoin. To protect the integrity of the network, we need to\n> eliminate single points of failure. An inbred Bitcoin with the same\n> software code everywhere shares the same weaknesses, and is\n> susceptible to the same attacks...\n>\n> The implications of a diversified Bitcoin is a Bitcoin difficult to\n> control. It also sets the protocol in stone, as nobody has sole power\n> over the standard. Consensus from many parties is the way forwards.\n>...\n> Viewed over a longer time period, extra or unnecessary features seem\n> to creep into the system beyond the initial goals and the small code\n> of 15,000 lines set by Satoshi. The result will be a Bitcoin that\n> becomes increasingly difficult to understand or implement without a\n> huge initial investment of resources, time and people.

Bitcoin XT is not necessarily an attack over Bitcoin and will not\nsplit it into 2 different coins. It is the result of an open source free\nsystem which lacks centralization. It is just at early stage, it could\nhave thousands for forks (or fork attempts) during its life.\n\n2. We have no proof that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are trying to do\nsomething bad to Bitcoin. So far everything they have done is (or should\nbe) allowed. They have forked an open source software and implemented a\nvoting system for a consensus rule change - doesn't sound like they are\ncommitting a crime here (either legally or morally). If they are\nqualified enough to maintain the software, or if the decision is\ntechnically correct or not is another story, and it should only matter\nto whoever uses / wants to use -XT.\n\n3. If Bitcoin's value can be decreased (or Bitcoin as a project killed)\njust by 2 people forking the software and submitting a consensus rule to\na vote, it means Bitcoin is dead already and it should be worthless! We\ncan't go around and panic every time somebody forks Bitcoin and tries to\nchange something - this should be allowed by the nature of its license.\nIf tomorrow 5 more people fork 5 different software implementing the\nbitcoin protocol and submit 5 different new consensus rules to a vote,\nthen what? We should all sell so the price will drop to 1 cent, because\nit is somehow not good enough, not stable enough?\n\nI can fork tomorrow Bitcoin Core to a Bitcoin-XYZ software which at some\nblock in the future spends all the longest dusted coins to me, out of\nwhich I give away 50% to the miners (so the hashing power will have\nincentive to use my fork).\n\nCan they do it?

By having a software fork and consensus rule submitted to vote we\nactually prove how open Bitcoin is, and how there is lack of control\nover it from all parties (developers, miners, engineers on the mail\nlist).

It just relies on the majority of the\nminers not attacking the network for too long (ie the number of\nconfirmations people are waiting).\nIf I'm running a full node, I'm not isolated from the network and the\nmajority of the hashrate is not reorging the chain I am safe no matter\nhow dishonest the \"majority\" (whatever that means in this context) is."

If shouldn't matter if somebody who forks\nalso tries lobbying to Bitcoin companies and miners and also trying to\nconvince users to adopt the fork. Bitcoin should be immune to such\nattacks, otherwise it is really flawed.\n\nThink of a very unlikely but not theoretically impossible example:\nThe Prime Minister of X with a government controlled authority forks\nBitcoin and changes a very important consensus rule. To ensure adoption\nat hashing power level, he issues an order and raises electricity cost\nfor the entire population with 10 cents or so, and compensates the\nminers adopting his fork with free electricity to mine Bitcoin. What\nbetter stimulator could a miner get if not this one?\n\nThis is a social problem, not a technical one. There is no code in\nBitcoin or rule in the protocol itself to defend against such a thing.\n\nWhat can and will make this attack impossible?\nThe users (economic power) which always ultimately should win any\ndispute will refuse using the coins mined by the miners adopting the\ncontroversial fork, which means the coins they mine will be worthless.\nEven if they are created with low costs / free electricity, the mined\ncoins will still be worthless so it won't worth it for the miners to\ntake this step. Better pay for electricity and win something less vs.\nnot paying for electricity but winning nothing.\n\nThe same with -XT, nobody should be able to affect the entire bitcoin\necosystem regardless how many miners or bitcoin companies you can lobby.\nIf this is possible, then Bitcoin is not as secure as we thought.\n\n>> I can fork tomorrow Bitcoin Core to a Bitcoin-XYZ software which at some\n>> block in the future spends all the longest dusted coins to me, out of\n>> which I give away 50% to the miners (so the hashing power will have\n>> incentive to use my fork).\n>>\n>> Can they do it?

It's true that a\nsoftware fork is nothing alike a Schism hardfork. I am still optimistic\nthat we aren't at a Schism hardfork yet and hope we won't get there and\n-XT will rejoin in following the consensus rule and stop this division.\n\n>> 4.

If 75% of the hashing power wants\nto do something which you don't agree to, as an user you don't have any\nreal options to prevent them. Only game them as in don't use bitcoin to\ndecrease its value so they are mining worthless or less valuable coins -\nbut by this you are hitting Bitcoin as a whole and not just the miners."

But I just\nmaintain what I've said when arguments of authority (an old fallacy)\nhave been used: only the arguments matter, not who makes them (which\nis also what logic says).\nMaybe the people using the arguments of authority actually care about\nwhether the author is Satoshi or not to determine what they think\nabout what the content says.\nBut I personally don't care: I can say that I agree with what the post\nsays no matter if it is written by Satoshi or someone else (because\nthe identity of the author doesn't change what I think of the\ncontent)."

Currently every single\nthing Satoshi ever apparently wrote can only be linked together by\ntrusting third parties - email archives could have been hacked,\nbitcointalk might have fake messages, etc. Obviously in practice we have\nreasonable assurance that the same person or group was behind most of\nthe messages we now consider to be \"from Satoshi\", but ultimately\nstrictly speaking we can only take each message individually, for the\narguments contained within.\n\nAs you've often said, the biggest achievement by Satoshi in the creation\nof Bitcoin was to create a system where the identity of the creator is a\nmere historical footnote. We can probably go further, and state that\nwhile doing so, Satoshi quite counter-intuitively took steps to avoid\neven creating a pseudoanonymous identity.\n\n\n1) \"Does anyone have anything at all signed by Satoshi's PGP key?\",\n   Peter Todd, Sept 13, 2014, Bitcoin-development mailing list,\n   http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2014-September/006606.html\n\n-- \n'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org\n00000000000000000402fe6fb9ad613c93e12bddfc6ec02a2bd92f002050594d\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 650 bytes\nDesc: Digital signature\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150817/129d0f20/attachment.sig>"

Myself and\nmany other people warned Gavin a network fork \"war\" would start (ie\nsomeone would think of some way to sabotage or attack the deployment\nof Bitcoin-XT via protocol, code, policy, consensus soft-fork etc.  He\nignored the warnings.  Many also warned that 75% was an optimally BAD\ntrigger ratio (and that in a hard fork it is not a miner vote really\nas in soft-forks).  Gavin & Mike ignored that warning to.  I know they\nheard those warnings because I told them 1:1 in person or via email\nand had on going conversations.  Others did too.\n\nPeople can not blame bitcoin core or me, that this then predictably\nhappened exactly as we said it would - it was completely obvious and\npredictable.\n\nIn fact noBitcoinXT is even more dangerous and therefore amplified in\neffect in creating mutual assured destruction kind of risk profile\nthan the loose spectrum of technical counters imagined.  I did not\npersonally put much effort into thinking about counters because I\nthough it counter productive and hoped that Gavin & Mike would have\nthe maturity to not start down such a path.\n\nAgain any of the other proposals can easily be implemented.  They\n*could* also spin up a web page and put up binaries, however no one\nelse was crazy enough to try to start a deployment in that way.\n\nIt is also puzzling timing - with all these BIPs and ongoing\ndiscussion and workshops coming imminently to then release ahead of\nthat process where as far as I know Gavin said he was equally happy\nwith BIP 100 or other proposal which ever is best, and on basically\nthe eve of workshops planned to progress this collaboratively.\nBitcoin-XT is also under tested, people are finding privacy bugs and\nother issues.  (Not even mentioning the above 75% optimally bad\nparameter, and the damage to community reputation and collaborative\nenvironment that this all causes.)\n\nVery disappointing Gavin and Mike.\n\nI find it quite notable that Gavin and Mike have been radio silent on\nthe bitcoin-dev list and yet we see a stream of media articles, blog\nposts, pod casts, and from what I can tell ongoing backroom lobbying\nof companies to run bitcoin-XT without trying AT ALL to offer a\nneutral or balanced or multi proposal information package so that\ncompanies technical people can make a balanced informed decision.\nThat is what the workshops are trying to provide.\n\nGavin, Mike - anything to say here?\n\nAdam\n\nOn 18 August 2015 at 19:59, Angel Leon via bitcoin-dev\n<bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> \"How then to end this XT madness?\"\n>\n> Instead of bashing on someone that has actually put a solution forward, make\n> your own fork and see if your ideas on how to solve the issue are any\n> better.\n>\n> As of now, 1Mb blocks are pure madness, and people are voting over an 8mb\n> block increase every day that passes, even with a \"useless project\" like you\n> call it.\n>\n> Go out there and see how bitcoin is actually used.\n>\n> http://twitter.com/gubatron\n>\n> On Tue, Aug 18, 2015 at 10:54 PM, odinn via bitcoin-dev\n> <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n>>\n>> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n>> Hash: SHA1\n>>\n>> The \"XT Fork\" (better said, a POS alt*) and those behind it make not\n>> even a pretense to work through process involved with bitcoin developmen\n>> t.\n>>\n>> (*This is not intended as a slight toward any other alts, as here in\n>> this post I am focusing solely on XT.)\n>>\n>> Instead of abandoning their useless project, or at least conceding\n>> that their alt is operating essentially outside of the development\n>> funnel (by this I mean BIP process), the developers of XT, via their\n>> latest presentation of XT give nothing more than an attack on bitcoin\n>> (albeit one that, more than anything, is designed to sidetrack real\n>> discussion necessary to resolve the issues so as to achieve some level\n>> of consensus in block size debates).

But\nas you know I differ with you on this point:\n\n> Once we have libconsensus Bitcoin Core it's just another\n> implementation\n\nI do not consider Bitcoin Core just another implementation as long as\nlibconsensus is built directly out of the bitcoind repository. It's a\nfiner point, but an important one. Eric makes this point emphatically as\nwell:\n\n>> But the consensus code should NOT be subject to the same commit\npolicies...and we should make an effort to separate the two clearly.\n\nAs you have implied, it's not likely to happen in the Bitcoin Core repo.\nTaking a dependency on Bitcoin Core is a metaphorical deal with the\ndevil from our perspective. So my question is, how do you expect other\nimplementations to transition off of that repository (and commit\npolicies)? Or do you expect the dependency to be perpetual?\n\nIn our discussion leading up to libbitcoin building libbitcoin-consensus\nwe disagreed on whether intentional hard forks would (or even could)\nhappen. I think that issue is now settled.

We never would have considered forking Bitcoin\nCore, and still wouldn't. Why would we set ourselves up for this\ndisruption, which would inevitably lead to us factoring the consensus\nportions of libconsensus out of /bitcoin at the 11th hour?\n\nWe have to operate as if it can happen at any time. Otherwise we have\nrelinquished control of this vote and failed our users. Given that\noperating assumption, it is much safer for us to have already done this\nwork (which we did). [It also provides a forcing function for us to\nreview in detail any consensus changes that get pushed out.]\n\nMy question is why you would not embrace an independent consensus\nrepository? Your work to evolve it doesn't change.\n\n>> There are a very small number of implementations that rely on consensus\n>> (fewer that aren't also forks of Bitcoin Core).

However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.  For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.\n\nRe: full nodes, my thinking along those lines has been:\n\n1) Incentivising full-nodes is a red herring\n\nWe can look at this from multiple angles. From the point of view of a\nwallet, it's not very secure to use Hearn-style SPV mode, and volunteers\nrunning full nodes doesn't help things. Sybil attacking the IP address\nspace is pretty easy in comparison to aquiring hashing power sufficient\nto create false confirmations, so any attacker able to do the former\nwill likely be running the full node you're connecting too anyway.\nUltimately, Hearn-style SPV is a close approximation to just trusting\nanyone with a non-trivial amount of hashing power. (and getting that is\nsurprisingly easy, e.g. w/ SPV mining)\n\nFrom the point of view of full node or miner, having your peers be\nvaliating nodes is at best just a bandwidth optimization; all you need\nfrom the rest of the P2P network is flood-fill capability with\nreasonable DoS resistance. This isn't a problem that strongly requires\nvalidation, and if bandwidth needs started to get excessive, sharding\nthe flood-fill network to limit bandwidth of any one flood-fill peer\nwould be relatively easy.\n\n\n2) The best incentive to validate is clear and immediate failure when you don't\n\nCurrently the game theory and attacks possible against non-validating\nnodes is a very complex landscape, full of cases where small attacks are\ninfeasible, but larger attacks possible. In particular, in many cases\nyou have co-ordination problems, where an attack is only viable if you\ncan steal at least a block reward worth of Bitcoins to make up for your\nopportunity cost. This risks lulling people into complacency as attacks\nseem rare, even if the risk is still quite high as the few attacks that\nwill happen will be very high impact.\n\nIf the system as a whole made small-scale attacks easier, we wouldn't\nsee this complacency, and people would build stronger systems. A\nconcrete example is Gregory Maxwell's idea of having all blocks commit\nto two separate merkle trees, one valid and one invalid. Determining\nwhich was which would require active validation, and because the block\nas a whole is still valid regardless, this gives the opportunity to run\nconstant \"fire drills\" to uncover flaws in validation. Notable, this\nscheme would even be compatible with SPV clients provided that all\nsources of invalidity can be proven with a compact fraud proof.\n\nA more extreme version of this notion is my embedded consensus ideas,\nwhere you rely on the PoW for only proof-of-publication and/or\nanti-replay functionality. Determining if coins (or any other asset) are\nreal becomes a clear job of validating history yourself, and/or trusting\nothers to do that validation. For instance, my smartcolors colored-coin\nprotocol work implemented client-side validation of colored coins, with\na planned (but not fully implemented - client ran out of funds)\noptimization/trust tradeoff of having the issuer periodically sign\nmerkle-trees committing to all valid proofs within the system on an\noffline machine.\n\n-- \n'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org\n00000000000000000402fe6fb9ad613c93e12bddfc6ec02a2bd92f002050594d\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 650 bytes\nDesc: Digital signature\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150817/40c39e66/attachment.sig>"

With sufficient hashpower, you can construct an SPV\nproof which sends 1,000 bitcoin to the victim. The attack is\n\"overloadable\" in the sense that the attacker is never out of money\n(they never needed to have 1,000 BTC in the first place). Whereas if the\nvictim is running a full node, the attacker must be signing and spending\nreal outputs in their control, there is a possibility in a re-org that\nthe victim will eventually get their money if it gets re-orged back.\n\nOn a more fundamental level, the SPV attack isn't on re-orging real/live\ntransactions, it's an attack on *how much money you currently have*. If\nthe client is using SPV, they never had the money in the first place\nwhen attacked, irrespective of re-orgs.\n\nIt is possible to attack thousands of people at once (everyone gets\n1,000 bitcoin in false transactions) with a fraction of the hashpower\n(lie in wait until you get a sufficiently long chain of blocks). If you\nwished to attack a full-node, it requires you orphaning a chain of valid\nblocks *live*, meaning you have to send real coins in a real transaction\nto the victim first. With SPV validation, you only need to construct a\nchain of invalid blocks off the current blockheight *whenever*. This\nmeans you can attack with substantially less hashpower; you don't need\n51% of the hashpower to attack SPV wallets. It may be economically\nunviable to attack a single victim with a full node within a very short\ntimeframe, but it can be economically viable to attack thousands of\nvictims doing SPV validation in a long timeframe.\n\nNote I'm not arguing that SPV should be compeletely avoided, I don't\nhave a solid opinion on that (and some threats can definitely be\nmitigated in various ways, and I certainly like/appreciate the\nconvenience of SPV), but the current SPV security model is definitely\nweaker than running a full node (if you're handling a lot of money, you\nshould be running a full node), are these issues not well-known by all\nin the bitcoin community?\n\n-- \nJoseph Poon"

                "message_text_only": "In these shocking forking times, nothing more relaxing that to immerse\nyourself in a pure technical reading about cryptocurrency design, letting\naside Bitcoin politics for a moment. This message is about cryptocurrencies\ndesign in general, so you're free to skip my message if you think it will\nnever apply to Bitcoin.\n\n[ full article copied from my blog:\nhttps://bitslog.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/how-decor-can-eradicate-selfish-mining-incentive-by-design/\n]\n\nA year ago I proposed the DECOR protocol\n<https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/decor/>, a new rule for\ncryptocurrencies to reduce significantly the amount of orphan blocks and\nthen allow block rate to be as high as one block every 5 seconds, and at\nthe same time it promised to address the problem of selfish mining\n<http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/>. After one\nyear, I\u2019ve received very little feedback about it. Yet the selfish mining\n<http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/> problem has\nbeen argued over and over against certain changes in Bitcoin, as if selfish\nmining were something inevitable to all POW-based cryptocurrencies. But it\nis not.\n\nIn a nutshell, DECOR is a protocol that permits miners to share the block\nreward if both mine competing blocks. This is done by publishing block\nheader siblings (sometime called uncles) into child blocks, and modifying\nthe cryptocurrency protocol to pay some amount to the miners of uncles. If\nall miners are honest, this strategy increases slightly the probability of\n1-block reversals, but reduces considerably the probability of longer\nreversals, as all miners choose the same parent. A few months after my\npost, Ethereum <https://www.ethereum.org/>adopted a similar strategy of\npaying a certain amount of ether to uncles, but the amount paid was created\nout of thin ear, and at that time there could be any amount of uncles, so\nbasically it distorted the money supply function into a uncapped\ninflationary one, if all miners decided to collude. After I reported this\nissue, they restricted the number of uncles that can be included, but still\nit leaves an incentive for all miners to collude to increase miner revenue.\nDECOR does reward sharing, so the supply function cap is maintained. But it\ndoes not solve the Selfish mining problem: miners withholding a block get\npaid a full reward but the remaining miners are working (without knowing\nit) for a half of the block reward. So my original strategy does not work\nfor rational (but not necessarily honest) miners. A few posts later I\npresented DECOR+ <https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/05/07/decor-2/> to try\nto address the problem of unbalanced rewards: what happens if there are two\ncompeting blocks, but one has a 12.5 BTC reward, but the other has a 20 BTC\nreward due to additional fees? But again, if miners are dishonest, the\nproposed scheme does not solve the underlying problem, as miners can\nartificially increase their fees to win the conflict resolving rule, at\nleast in all cryptocurrencies that do not burn transaction fees. How can we\nfix it?\n\n*DECOR++*\n\nWe\u2019ll fix DECOR by doing three changes. The first is by paying full rewards\nto all competing blocks, either the parent or the uncles. To prevent\nincreasing the money supply, first we set a maximum number of uncles U than\ncan be included over a period of N blocks. For example we can set U=100 and\nN=1000 (a maximum orphan rate of 10%). Then we create rule to decrease the\nmoney supply per time interval in case it previously was increased. So to\nprevent miners colluding to increase the money supply in U/N, we either\ndecrease the subsidies of the following N blocks by the excess amount in\nthe previous period or we make N coincident with block difficulty re-target\ninterval and we consider uncles in the rate computation, so mining\nafterward simply gets more difficult. If all miners collude to try to\nincrease their revenue by U/N, they will see their revenue decrease by the\nsame amount in the following re-target interval.\n\nMiners could start switching between two cryptocurrencies to mine only\nduring the low difficulty interval and avoid the high difficulty interval.\nBut here are no competing valuable non-merged mined cryptocurrency using\nSHA256D, so this is no problem for Bitcoin. Also the cryptocurrency left\nwithout mining power would become insecure and its price will fall to near\nzero. So increasing the immaturity lock time for coinbases to at least N\nblocks destroys any miner earnings if all decide to switch all at once.\n\nThe second change is to choose the parent block in case of conflict based\non a deterministic random selection in case of deciding between several\nchains with the same accumulated difficulty but different tip: we order the\ncompeting tip blocks by their hash digest values, we hash the hashes and we\nuse the resulting hash digest as seed to a PRNG to choose an index in the\nsorted list of the block to choose as parent.\n\nThe third change is to process the transactions of all competing blocks\n(the actual block and its siblings) in case of a conflict. The transactions\non the parent block will be processed first as normal. The others will be\nprocessed in the order they are referenced in following child blocks.\nConflicting transactions (double-spends) present in uncle blocks with\nrespect to the main block are skipped, while obviously internal conflicts\nin the uncle blocks make them invalid, as usual. Now, as long as the\nsubsidy dominates the fees, miners have no incentive to withhold blocks.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze what can happen in the long term, when fees dominate the\nblock reward. In the future there may be two kinds of transactions: public\ntransactions and private transactions. Public transactions are the current\nstandard transactions: they pay a fee in the standard way and are broadcast\nover the public network. Private transactions may appear if miners decide\nto negotiate inclusion in blocks directly with web wallets or gateways:\nprivate transactions will pay fees as an output to the miner\u2019s public key.\nBlocks with high rewards competing with blocks with low rewards due to\npublic transactions will be rare, since for the benefit of the miner most\ntransactions included in blocks should be present in all other miners\nmemory pools to accelerate propagation, so all miners are exposed to the\nsame reward pool. If it happens (by the mistake of a user) that a public\ntransaction pays an extremely high fee, the withholding incentive may\nreappear. But in a far future, when subsidy disappears and miners receive\nthe payment mainly because of fees, they may adopt the more competitive\ncommercial strategy of rely mainly in private transactions (or maybe using Mike\nHearn\u2019s assurance contracts\n<https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Funding_network_security>). As fees from\nprivate transactions are not shared between competing blocks, they won\u2019t\naffect selfish mining. I conclude that DECOR++ is currently incentive\ncompatible and it is highly probable that remains incentive compatible in\nthe future.\n\nTo summarize, DECOR++ main protocol properties are:\n\n   - Choose a parent by a deterministic pseudo-random coin toss based on\n   competing block headers\n   - Give standard subsidy to all competing blocks by including uncles in\n   following blocks\n   - Give small monetary incentive to include uncle blocks in blocks\n   (miners including blocks can get a small share of included blocks rewards).\n   - Give small monetary incentive to choose deterministically one of the\n   competing blocks as the main block (this can be done by burning some reward\n   share if other parent is chosen).\n   - Process all transactions in uncle blocks, quietly skipping the ones\n   that conflict with existing ones.\n   - Pay fees to original miners for all non-conflicting transactions in\n   uncle blocks\n   - Decrease the money supply in blocks following blocks including uncles\n   to compensate for the increase in money supply.\n   - Limit the amount of uncles that can be included over an interval of\n   blocks, and make that interval long enough to capture normal variances in\n   orphan rates.\n   - Increase the coinbase immaturity period to at least the period of\n   money supply compensation.\n\nBest regards, Sergio.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150816/a101786f/attachment.html>"

Part\nof the issue is that \"block size\" doesn't actually measure resource usage\nvery reliably. It is possible to support a much higher volume of typical\nusage transactions than transactions specifically constructed to cause DoS\nissues. But if \"block size\" is the knob being tweaked, then you must design\nfor the DoS worst case, not the average/expected use case.\n\nAdditionally, there is an issue of time horizons and what presumed\nimprovements are made to the client. Bitcoin Core today can barely handle\n1MB blocks, but that's an engineering limitation. So are we assuming fixes\nthat aren't actually deployed yet? Should we raise the block size before\nthat work is tested and its performance characteristics validated?\n\nIt's a complicated issue without easy answers, and that's why you're not\nseeing straightforward statements of \"2MB\", \"8MB\", or \"20MB\" from most of\nthe developers.\n\nBut that's not to say that people aren't doing anything. There is a\nworkshop being organized for September 12-13th that will cover much of\nthese \"it's complicated\" issues. There will be a follow-on workshop in the\nNov/Dec timeframe in which specific proposals will be discussed.

For better or worse, it is *very hard* to change the rules\u2026and this is exactly what imbues Bitcoin with one of its most powerful attributes: very well-defined settlement guarantees that cannot be suddenly altered nor reversed by anyone.\n\nWe\u2019ve managed to have a few soft forks in the past\u2026and for the most part these changes have been pretty uncontroversial\u2026or at least, they have not had nearly the level of political divisiveness that this block size issue is having. And even then, we\u2019ve encountered a number of problems with these deployments that have at times required goodwill cooperation between developers and mining pool operators to fix.\n\nAgain, we have NEVER attempted anything even remotely like what\u2019s being proposed - we\u2019ve never done any sort of hard fork before like this.

All so we can process 8 times the number of transactions we currently do? Even if it were 100 times, we wouldn\u2019t even come close to touching big payment processors like Visa.

But it\u2019s still a baby\u2026and this is a serious problem indeed, because on the one hand we don\u2019t want any central authority but on the other it still needs some guardians\u2026and we don\u2019t have anything resembling the kind of institution that could possibly be entrusted to nurture and care for this baby until it is ready to go out on its own.\n\nImagine, when the US Constitution was being written, if suddenly everyone started to just propose their own different version of it and insisting (under threat of fork) on their own versions before any sort of government could be created. Yes, I know the US federal government is not exactly the paragon of decentralization\u2026but regardless of your views on the US government, it\u2019s still a somewhat analogous situation. Until the system was in place, some people (who at the time were unelected) had to bootstrap the process.\n\nFor better or worse, Satoshi has left the picture\u2026and no clear succession model was put in place. The Bitcoin Foundation, which for a time attempted to be a guardian institution, ended up self-destructing. It was an utter failure.\n\nWe don\u2019t have any sort of institution like this\u2026and we don\u2019t really want one. But the system is still not fully in place. Importantly, we lack any mechanisms to be able to make potentially controversial changes without serious risks.\n\nIt would be amazing if despite this trial-by-fire we still survived and managed to pull through. And if we do we\u2019ll be stronger for it. But quite sincerely, I would have wanted the system to be a little more mature before putting it through this trial. At least I would have liked to have gone through a test hard-fork using a far less politically divisive issue.\n\nAnyhow, completely separate from my views on governance, etc\u2026my main point is that we\u2019re ALL trying to do what\u2019s best given our understanding and resources\u2026and we\u2019ve all poured our hearts and souls into this. We might disagree on certain things, but let\u2019s stop this negativity and misrepresentation and try to figure out a way forward that is less likely to lead to a war.\n\n\n- Eric\n\n> \n> \n> Eric Lombrozo via bitcoin-dev <bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> schrieb am Mo., 17.

It\u2019s too easy to spin resistance to bigger blocks (even though the resistance is actually much more towards untested hardforking mechanisms and serious security concerns) as \u201cobstructionism\u201d and it\u2019s too easy to spin bigger blocks as \u201cscalability\u201d because most of the people can\u2019t tell the fucking difference.\n\nThe fact is most of the people don\u2019t really understand the fundamental issue and are taking sides based on charismatic leadership and authority which is actually entirely counter to the spirit of decentralized consensus.

Bitcoin simply does not have a reliable and tested hard forking mechanism\u2026and a hard fork for such a politically divisive issue will almost certainly lead to a lack of cooperation and refusal to work together out of spite.

Can anyone imagine that they have not hired highly skilled\npsychological warfare agnts to do everything they can to \"help\" assault\nwhat we decentralization enthusiasts have been working for?\n\nAbout #2: I'm actually blind to hostility, and that is an intentional\naffectation in response to my recognition of #1 and #3 together.  If you\nfeel another person has expressed a bad idea, just ignore it.  If you feel\nthey might be misleading others, post a reply about what you know to clear\nup any possible misconceptions.  There is no point in identifying\nindividuals who are being hostile, or pointing out hostility, or being\ndivisive.  Let the rest of us recognize it on our own.

If you assume\nthe best intentions of another person, you will eventually find yourself in\none of two places.  Either you will find truth with that person (becuase\nthey are also seeking it), or you will drive them away (because you will ask\nquestions that can't be answered by someone trying to deceive).\n\n2) The Wiki says \"The current Core developers are Wladimir J. van der Laan,\nGavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Gregory Maxwell, and Pieter Wuille.\"  I've seen\nno hostility from any of these people.\n\n3) The people who are threatened by Bitcoin aren't stupid enough to ignore\n#1.  Can anyone imagine that they have not hired highly skilled\npsychological warfare agnts to do everything they can to \"help\" assault what\nwe decentralization enthusiasts have been working for?\n\nAbout #2: I'm actually blind to hostility, and that is an intentional\naffectation in response to my recognition of #1 and #3 together.  If you\nfeel another person has expressed a bad idea, just ignore it.  If you feel\nthey might be misleading others, post a reply about what you know to clear\nup any possible misconceptions.  There is no point in identifying\nindividuals who are being hostile, or pointing out hostility, or being\ndivisive.  Let the rest of us recognize it on our own.  Maybe send something\nlike what I'm writing now.\n\nPS: If anyone is interested in conspiracy theories, I had written this into\nmy gmail compose window and (presumably) hit a wrong key which caused the\nthread to be marked as spam and deleted my whole reply.

If Bitcoin-XT\ndidn't had a schism hardfork, nobody would be calling it \"an altcoin\".\nFor consensus rules we use \"the implementation is the specification\"\nas a principle for multiple reasons. By separating libconsensus (a\nwork in progress [far less progress than I would like]) we remove\nBitcoin Core's privileged position: Bitcoin Core wouldn't be \"the\nspecification of the consensus rules\" anymore, just a reference\nimplementation that is not \"consensus-safer\" compared to alternative\nimplementations (since they can use libconsensus directly [or a\nsoftware fork of it in the case of a reasonable schism hardfork]).\n\n> That's why we shouldn't fear hard forks - they are the new reality, and if we cannot set up a reliable process for them to happen then there _is_ no decentralized Bitcoin and we all might as well just give up and go home.\n\nWe have many reasons to fear schism hardforks (\nhttps://github.com/jtimon/bips/blob/bip-forks/bip-0099.mediawiki#Schism1_hardforks\n), even though they may be unavoidable at some point (ie for an\nASIC-reset hardfork)."

Just because you observe a miner producing\nempty blocks doesn't mean he is SPV mining.\n\nThere can be many reasons for mining on an empty block even after having\nfully verified the previous block.

You cannot conclude that miners are\nstruggling with a certain block size.\n\nFor example, there are reasons rooted in the mining hardware and mining\nsoftware itself, which have nothing to do with the node software, in\nparticular not with block propagation, verification or transaction\nselection.

Here's a copy of the text:-\n\n*Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap\n<http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php>*\n\n*Assumption*: This article is for those, who already understand the bitcoin\nprotocol and aware of the block size controversy. Details of the problem\nstatement can be found in BIP 100\n<http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf>.\nSatoshi's opinion regarding block size can be found here\n<https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366>. I will be\ndirectly going into the solution without explaining the problem in details.\n\n\n*Solution*: Difficulty changes at every 2016 block, i.e. at every 2016\nblock each full node does a calculation to find the next target. We will do\njust another calculation here. Nodes will also calculate what % of blocks\nin the last difficulty period is higher than 90% of the maximum block size,\nwhich is 1 MB for now. If it is found that more than 90% blocks in the last\ndifficulty period is higher than 90% of the maximum block size, then double\nthe maximum block size. If not, then calculate what % of blocks in the last\ndifficulty period is less than 50% of the maximum block size. If it is\nhigher than 90%, then half the maximum block size. If none of the above\ncondition satisfies, keep the maximum block size as it is.\n\nPlease note that, while calculating the % of blocks, it is better to take\ninto account the first 2000 of the 2016, than the whole of 2016. This helps\nto avoid the calculation mistake if some of the last few blocks get\norphaned.\n\n\n*Reasoning*: This solution is derived directly from the indication of the\nproblem. If transaction volume increases, then we will naturally see bigger\nblocks. On the contrary, if there are not enough transaction volume, but\nmaximum block size is high, then only few blocks may sweep the mempool.\nHence, if block size is itself taken into consideration, then maximum block\nsize can most rationally be derived. Moreover, this solution not only\nincreases, but also decreases the maximum block size, just like difficulty.\n\n\n*Other Solutions of this Problem*:-\n\nMaking Decentralized Economic Policy\n<http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf> - by\nJeff Garzik\n\nElastic block cap with rollover penalties\n<https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1078521> \u2013 by Meni Rosenfeld\n\nIncrease maximum block size\n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki> - by Gavin\nAndresen\n\nBlock size following technological growth\n<https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6> - by Pieter Wuille\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments\n<https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf> - by Joseph Poon &\nThaddeus Dryja\n\n\nPlease share your opinion regarding this solution below.

I think 2016\nblocks is too much of a wait, I think we should look at the mean block size\nduring the last 60-120 minutes instead and avert any crisis caused by\ntransactional spikes that could well be caused by organic use of the\nnetwork (Madonna sells her next tour tickets on Bitcoin, OpenBazaar network\nstarts working as imagined, XYZ startup really kicks ass and succeeds in a\ncouple of major cities with major PR push)\n\nPseudo code in Python\nhttps://gist.github.com/gubatron/143e431ee01158f27db4\n\nMy idea stems from a simple scalability metric that affects real users and\nthe desire to use Bitcoin:\nWaiting times to get your transactions confirmed on the blockchain.\nAnything past 45mins-1 hour should be unnacceptable.\n\nInitially I wanted to measure the mean time for the transactions in blocks\nto go from being sent by the user\n(initial broadcast into mempools) until the transaction was effectively\nconfirmed on the blockchain, say for 2 blocks (acceptable 15~20mins)\n\nWhen blocks get full, people start waiting unnaceptable times for their\ntransactions to come through\nif they don't adjust their fees. The idea is to avoid that situation at all\ncosts and keep the network\nchurning to the extent of its capabilities, without pretending a certain\nsize will be right at some\npoint in time, nobody can predict the future, nobody can predict real\norganic usage peaks\non an open financial network, not all sustained spikes will come from\nspammers,\nthey will come from real world use as more and more people think of great\nuses for Bitcoin.\n\nI presented this idea to measure the mean wait time for transactions and I\nwas told\nthere's no way to reliably meassure such a number, there's no consensus\nwhen transactions are still\nin the mempool and wait times could be manipulated. Such an idea would have\nto include new timestamp fields\non the transactions, or include the median wait time on the blockheader\n(too complex, additional storage costs)\n\nThis is an iteration on the next thing I believe we can all agree is 100%\naccurately measured, blocksize.\nFull blocks are the cause why many transactions would have to be waiting in\nthe mempool, so we should be able\nto also use the mean size of the blocks to determine if there's a\nlegitimate need to increase or reduce the\nmaximum blocksize.\n\nThe idea is simple, If blocks are starting to get full past a certain\nthreshold then we double the blocksize\nlimit starting the next block, if blocks remain within a healthy bound,\ntransaction wait times should be as\nexpected for everyone on the network, if blocks are not getting that full\nand the mean goes below a certain\nthreshold then we half the maximum block size allowed until we reach the\nlevel we need.\nSimilar to what we do with hashing difficulty, it's something you can't\npredict, therefore no fixed limits,\nor predicted limits should be established.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150817/795d714c/attachment.html>"

(remember that we shouldn't preclude variance reduction\ntechniques such as p2pool and pooled-solo mode)\n\nEqually, what kind of attacks on miners do you think we need to be able to\nresist? E.g.

                "message_text_only": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA512\n\nHi all,\n\nIn collaboration with Mark Friedenbach, we have drawn up a proposal for\nusing\nthe median time of the past 11 blocks in locktime calculations.\n\n<pre>\n  BIP: XX\n  Title: Median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations\n  Author: Thomas Kerin <me at thomaskerin.io>\n          Mark Friedenbach <mark at friedenbach.org>    \n  Status: Draft\n  Type: Standards Track\n  Created: 2015-08-10\n</pre>\n\n\n==Abstract==\n\nThis BIP is a proposal to redefine the semantics used in determining a\ntime-locked transaction's eligibility for inclusion in a block. The\nmedian of the last 11 blocks is used instead of the block's timestamp,\nensuring that it increases monotonically with each block.\n\n\n==Motivation==\n\nAt present, transactions are excluded from inclusion in a block if the\npresent time or block height is less than or equal to that specified\nin the locktime. Since the consensus rules do not mandate strict\nordering of block timestamps, this has the unfortunate outcome of\ncreating a perverse incentive for miners to lie about the time of\ntheir blocks in order to collect more fees by including transactions\nthat by wall clock determination have not yet matured.\n\nThis BIP proposes comparing the locktime against the median of the\npast 11 block's timestamps, rather than the timestamp of the block\nincluding the transaction. Existing consensus rules guarantee this\nvalue to monotonically advance, thereby removing the capability for\nminers to claim more transaction fees by lying about the timestamps of\ntheir block.\n\nThis proposal seeks to ensure reliable behaviour in locktime calculations as\nrequired by BIP65, BIP68, and BIPXX (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY).\n\n\n==Specification==\n\nThe values for transaction locktime remain unchanged. The difference is\nonly in\nthe calculation determining whether a transaction can be included.\nInstead of\nan unreliable timestamp, the following function is used to determine the\ncurrent\nblock time for the purpose of checking lock-time constraints:\n\n    enum { nMedianTimeSpan=11 };\n    \n    int64_t GetMedianTimePast(const CBlockIndex* pindex)\n    {\n        int64_t pmedian[nMedianTimeSpan];\n        int64_t* pbegin = &pmedian[nMedianTimeSpan];\n        int64_t* pend = &pmedian[nMedianTimeSpan];\n        for (int i = 0; i < nMedianTimeSpan && pindex; i++, pindex =\npindex->pprev)\n             *(--pbegin) = pindex->GetBlockTime();\n        std::sort(pbegin, pend);\n        return pbegin[(pend - pbegin)/2];\n    }\n\nLock-time constraints are checked by the consensus method IsFinalTx(),\nor LockTime() under BIP68. These methods take the block time as one\nparameter. This BIP proposes that after activation calls to\nIsFinalTx() or LockTime() within consensus code use the return value\nof `GetMedianTimePast(pindexPrev)` instead.\n\nA reference implementation of this proposal is provided in the\nfollowing git repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/tree/medianpasttimelock\n\n\n==Deployment==\n\nWe reuse the double-threshold switchover mechanism from BIPs 34 and 66,\nwith the\nsame thresholds, but for block.nVersion = 4. The new rules are in effect for\nevery block (at height H) with nVersion = 4 and at least 750 out of 1000\nblocks\npreceding it (with heights H-1000...H-1) also have nVersion = 4.\nFurthermore,\nwhen 950 out of the 1000 blocks preceding a block do have nVersion = 4,\nnVersion = 3 blocks become invalid, and all further blocks enforce the\nnew rules.\n\nIt is recommended that this soft-fork deployment trigger include other\nrelated\nproposals for improving Bitcoin's lock-time capabilities, such as BIP\n65, BIP68\nand CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.\n\n\n==Acknowledgements==\n\nMark Friedenbach for designing and authoring the reference\nimplementation of this BIP.\n\nThomas Kerin authored this BIP document.\n\n\n==Compatibility==\n\nTransactions generated using time-based lock-time will take\napproximately an hour longer to confirm than would be expected under\nthe old rules. This is not known to introduce any compatibility\nconcerns with existing protocols.\n\n\n==References==\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki BIP65:\nOP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY]\n\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki BIP68:\nConsensus-enforced transaction replacement signaled via sequence numbers]\n\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-00.mediawiki BIPXX:\nCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY]\n\n\n==Copyright==\n\nThis document is placed in the public domain.\n\n\n\n\n- -- \nMy PGP key can be found here: <https://thomaskerin.io/me.pub.asc>\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v2\n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\nGmbe3i9G90rpgDbHWXFq\n=EQdY\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

From #bitcoin-wizards, 2013-07-16:\n\n23:57 < petertodd> See, it'd be possible for nLockTime w/ time-based locks to create some really ugly incentives for miners to mine blocks at thelimit of the 2hr window - a timestamping chain could provide a way for nodes to at least detect that their clocks are off, especially given how peers can mess with them.\n23:58 < petertodd> It's still dodgy though... I was thinking if nLockTime-by-time inclusion was based on the previous block timestamp it'd be ok, but that still leaves large miners with incentives to screw with the 2hr window, never mind how it can reduce competition if there exists clock skew in the mining nodes.\n--- Log closed Wed Jul 17 00:00:57 2013\n--- Log opened Wed Jul 17 00:00:57 2013\n00:01 < petertodd> (remember that if this is a timestamping facility any node wanting to know the current time simply gets a nonce timestamped, and then they know what time it is!)\n00:11 < Luke-Jr> I don't see how nLockTime can discourage forward-dating blocks\n00:11 < Luke-Jr> and there is no 2hr window backward..\n00:12 < Luke-Jr> well, I guess if miners are behaving there is <.<\n00:19 < petertodd> The problem is a block being created with nTime > actual time, and the incentive is to get a head start on other miners to put, say, a high-fee nLockTime in the block you are creating.\n00:21 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: but nLockTime only sets a minimum time, it cannot set a maximum\n00:22 < petertodd> but that's it, if I have a 1BTC fee tx, with nLockTime expiring in two hours, why not take the increased orphan chance and set nTime on my block to two hours ahead/\n00:22 < petertodd> ?\n00:22 < petertodd> yet if we allow that incentive, it's very bad for consensus\n00:23 < gmaxwell> ha. We can fix.\n00:23 < gmaxwell> it's a soft forking fix.\n00:23 < gmaxwell> use the last blocks ntime, not this one.\n00:23 < Luke-Jr> is sipa's secp256k1 branch reasonably stable?\n00:23 < petertodd> gmaxwell: that's what I said...\n00:24 < gmaxwell> petertodd: sorry I just read the last couple lines.\n00:24 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: AFAIK we already don't relay transactions with time in the future?\n00:24 < gmaxwell> petertodd: well I agree. (or not even the last block\u2014 it could use the minimum time)\n00:24 < petertodd> gmaxwell: The problem is, that's only a fix if mining power is well distributed, it actually makes things worse because if there is a lot of profit to be gained the miners with a lot of hashing power still have the incentive, and it's to a much greater degree.

The reason why is\nblocks with nVersion=0b001...000 - the intended deployment of the\nnVersion bits proposal - will be rejected by the nVersion >= 4 rule,\nhard-forking them off the network. In short, we have in fact \"burnt\" a\nversion bit unnecessarily.\n\nIf you're going to accept hard-forking some people off the network, why\nnot just go with my stateless nVersion bits w/ time-expiration proposal\ninstead? The only case where it leads to a hard-fork is if a soft-fork\nhas been rejected by the time the upgrade deadline is reached. It's easy\nto set this multiple years into the future, so I think in practice it\nwon't be a major issue for non-controversial soft-forks.\n\nEqually, spending the time to implement the original stateful nVersion\nbits proposal is possible as well, though higher risk due to the extra\ncomplexity of tracking soft-fork state.\n\n-- \n'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org\n000000000000000008ba8215b2b644e33a98a762fd40710bc5e8c7f1b0e78375\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 650 bytes\nDesc: Digital signature\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150827/c2490721/attachment.sig>"

                "message_text_only": "I have an ugly solution to this problem, with minimal change to the \ncurrent softfork logic, and still allows all features described in \nsipa's Version bits BIP\n\n1. xVersion = nVersion AND 0b10000000000000000000000000011000\n2. miners supporting BIP65 will set xVersion = 8 or greater\n3. If 750 of the last 1000 blocks are xVersion >= 8, reject invalid \nxVersion 8 (or greater) blocks\n4. If 950 of the last 1000 blocks are xVersion >= 8, reject all blocks \nwith xVersion < 8\n\nSo the logic is exactly the same as BIP66, with the AND masking in step \n1. After the BIP65 softfork is implied, xVersion may take only one of \nthe following values: 8, 16, 24\n\nThis is basically moving the \"high bits\" in sipa's proposal to the \nmiddle of the nVersion field. After the BIP65 softfork, this will still \nleave 29 available bits for parallel soft forks, just in different \nposition.\n\nThis is ugly, but I believe this is the easiest solution\n\nRef: https://gist.github.com/sipa/bf69659f43e763540550\n\nPeter Todd via bitcoin-dev \u65bc 2015-08-27 19:19 \u5beb\u5230:\n> On Thu, Aug 27, 2015 at 11:08:32PM +0100, Btc Drak wrote:\n>> This BIP was assigned number 113.\n>> \n>> I have updated the text accordingly and added credits to Gregory \n>> Maxwell.\n>> \n>> Please see the changes in the pull request:\n>> https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/182\n> \n> On Thu, Aug 27, 2015 at 11:11:10PM +0100, Btc Drak via bitcoin-dev \n> wrote:\n>> I have changed BIPS 112 and 113 to reflect this amended deployment\n>> strategy.

Please point out the incorrect ones.\n\n* Most developers here agree that 1 MB is not a magic constant and that the\nlimit has to increase eventually.\n\n* Most developers want to reduce the amount of policy decisions\nbitcoin-core makes as much as possible.\n\n* The most conservative option for the 4 billion dollar system that is\nbitcoin is to keep the limit.\n\n* Technological growth in bandwidth, cpu and storage exists and relative to\nthat growth, the blocksize limit is effectively decreased. Keeping the\nlimit as it is today, or was five years ago, means we need to adjust for\ntechnological growth.\n\n* Doing so will not reduce current decentralization, however measured.\n\n* Increasing the blocksize limit will always require a hard-fork.\nDecreasing, or stopping the growth of the blocksize limit will always be\npossible via soft-fork.\n\n* Problems arising from underestimating the need for a larger blocksize\nlimit are increasingly harder to fix. Problems arising from a limit that is\ngetting too high are more easy to fix.\n\n* This means we can be optimistic when estimating future technological\ngrowth.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150818/c30bf53a/attachment.html>"

When BIP101 is activated, these exchanges will \nrefuse to accept or exchange tokens from the old chain. Miners in the \nold chain can't sell their newly generated coins and can't pay the \nelectricity bill. They will soon realize that they are mining fool's \ngold and will be forced to switch to the new chain or sell their ASIC. \nThe old chain will be abandoned and has no hope to revive without a \nhardfork to decrease the difficulty. The dust will settle in days if not \nhours.\n\nWill the adoption of BitcoinXT lead by miners? No, it won't. Actually, \nChinese miners who control 60% of the network has already said that they \nwould not adopt XT. So they must not be the leader in this revolution. \nAgain, miners need to make sure they could sell their bitcoin in a good \nprice, and that's not possible without support of exchanges and \ninvestors.\n\nWhat about that Not-Bitcoin-XT? The creator of the spoof client may stay \nanonymous, but the miners cannot. 95% of the blocks come from known \nentities and they have to be responsible to their actions. And again, \nthey have real money in stake. If bitcoin is destroyed, their ASIC \nserves at best as very inefficient heaters.\n\nSo Bitcoin-XT is basically in a win-all-or-lose-all position. It all \nrelies on one condition: the support of major exchanges, merchants, and \ninvestors. Their consensus is what really matters. With their consensus, \nthat could not be a Schism hardfork. Without their consensus, nothing \nwill happen.\n\n-------\n\nOr let me analyse in a different angle. BitcoinXT is in no way similar \nto your examples of Schism hardforks. All of your examples, \"ASIC-reset \nhardfork\", \"Anti-Block-creator hardfork\", and \"Anti-cabal hardfork\", are \nhostile to the current biggest miners and will destroy their investment. \nThese miners have no choice but stick to the original protocol so 2 \nchains MUST coexist. However, BIP101 has no such effect at all and \nminers may freely switch between the forks. They will always choose the \nmost valuable fork, so only one fork will survive."

What would they do?\n\nOne scheme would be to create a taint system.  All non-XT coinbases outputs\nare marked as tainted.  All outputs are tainted if any of the inputs into a\ntransaction are tainted.  Tainted coins can only be un-tainted by sending\n0.5% of their value to the public address of one of the participating\nexchanges (or to OP_RETURN).  They could slowly ratchet up the surcharge.\n\nExchanges in the cartel agree not to exchange tainted coins.  Even if some\nstill do, the tainted coins are still inherently less valuable, since fewer\nexchanges accept them.\n\nSchemes like that are the main way for non-miners to flex their muscles,\neven if they seem unsavory.\n\nTaint tracking would allow merchants to participate.  They could give less\ncredit for tainted bitcoins, even if the exchanges are trying to remain\nneutral.  If that happens, the exchanges could run 2 prices, BTC and\nBTC-tainted.\n\nOn the other hand, implementing taint machinery is a bad thing for\nfungibility.\n\nIt can also be accomplished with checkpointing.  They need to create 1 big\nblock and then agree to checkpoint it.\n\nA less strict rule rule could be that blocks after the first big block\ncount as double POW.  That means that the big block chain only needs 34% of\nthe hashing power to win.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150819/5ac4a299/attachment.html>"

The experiment is not about a random \nhardfork. It's about a block size increase hardfork.

If one is undecided or does not have enough information\nregarding each BIP then dont fill it out. That also helps signal the\nlevel of consensus for a proposal.\n\nAs it stands at the moment, it's almost impossible to direct someone\nat the opinion of a specific developer other than hunting down a few\ngems scattered to the four corners of the universe.

I think most of\nus can comment on BIP101 since the BIP appears non-negotiable.\n\nThe XT faction are easily winning the media war by obscuring rational\ndebate by high signal to noise ratio. Nicolas' solution means the most\nimportant views expressed by each heavyweight will not get lost and\nserve as a good reference point for everyone, including the media.\n\nThe site could be extended to include major stakeholders too like\nmajor service providers (think exchanges, wallet providers etc) and\nmining pools."

For instance both of Garzik's proposals and Andresen's BIP101 have serious flaws regardless of your thoughts on the blocksize, which is why I've commented on them. Wuille's OTOH is implemented well, which is why I have not commented about it.\n\nWhat might be valuable is to ask devs to explain what their threat models are, what should be at the root of their thinking about the blocksize.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\niQE9BAEBCgAnIBxQZXRlciBUb2RkIDxwZXRlQHBldGVydG9kZC5vcmc+BQJV1u9o\nAAoJEMCF8hzn9Lncz4MH/0ZvaS+XK4+kVsgvdO0Mx8Axi8lesQoOSNafY1O8F4Tx\nQQcIWYk+QgST0wBOooqIkivlWUhXUUc0A22VvYJ2gOt+KCWCscXkOnPrHWMA2f80\n4KBEbLyFd+eaKQnCXoWX6SlDiYrNhyIySwAAvZyJ6IxTliUljuuk4Cc+K7pnVKu2\ntfaRXtoal3IzyVb/rxUafgRoCaR2QdkYfr+xwkeF9AjqYFUKL+p5zENV97cbLsiF\n/Rxtpe0A9RSClc+VX0yyjFAIIUfmFDWdC7+wNv8YBvHssE0lndPByxWTNVHnHmCk\n44XfrsSL0LAqPIqcxyK0hnUSUgKPo0c2chd9mlXHpYE=\n=eHHo\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

I\u2019m talking about active users of bitcoin.  I don\u2019t care if they send 10,000 BTC, or .01 BTC, usage is adoption.

You don\u2019t know if we will hit that limit in the next 6 years.  All it takes is one moderately successful application and we could be hitting that limit with very little warning.  It could be open bazaar, or something else.  Stating that \u201ceven after 6 years, hardly anyone owns Bitcoins.\u201d as a justification that it will stay small doesn\u2019t hold water either in terms of common sense or when looking at other standards evolving through history.  TCP/IP was declared as a standard by the US Military in 1982 and became a public standard in 1985.  Normal people didn\u2019t start using TCP/IP until much later, when Mark Andreessen created the Mosaic internet browser, the precursor to Netscape.  It was released in 1993.  Widespread use didn\u2019t really kick in until the second half of that decade.  The reference bitcoin client was released in January 2009.  So it\u2019s basically 1988 for bitcoin, if we use the internet as a proxy - one way to look at it.  The telephone even took 50 years to become widespread. \n\n> I don't think that a relative tight block size could harm Bitcoin\n> middle-term.

Capping the block size at 1MB doesn\u2019t just cause fees to rise.  It caps transactions that can be performed.  This caps the number of users who can access bitcoin, directly cuts demand, which kills the price, which kills the mining, and BAM Rome falls.  Only experienced users can \u201cpenetrate\u2019 the block chain directly?  Seriously?  You download a software application, or sign up for a web wallet, buy some bitcoin on an exchange or have a friend send you some, and send it.  Try bread wallet.  My mom can do it.  She is in her 70\u2019s and couldn\u2019t program a VCR 20 years ago.\n\nI am just going to stop here.  I really hope you change the way you are looking at bitcoin.  This is not what it was meant to be, and if it ever becomes this, I\u2019m not going to be interested in it.\n\n> On Aug 21, 2015, at 11:31 AM, Oliver Egginger <bitcoin at olivere.de> wrote:\n> \n> Am 21.08.2015 um 15:34 schrieb Will Madden:\n>> Keeping the block size at 1mb restricts the number of active users of bitcoin to around 100,000 people transacting twice a day on blockchain.  \n>> BItcoin is a protocol.

Both\nmine blocks with nVersion=0x20000007, which would falsely trigger the\npreviously suggested implementation using the IsSuperMajority()\nmechanism and nVersion=4 blocks. Additionally while the\nXT/Not-Bitcoin-XT software claims to support Wuille/Todd/Maxwell's\nnVersion soft-fork mechanism(3) a key component of it - fork\ndeadlines(3) - is not implemented.\n\n\nXT/Not-Bitcoin-XT behavior\n--------------------------\n\nBoth implementations produce blocks with nVersion=0x20000007,\nor in binary: 0b001...111\n\nNeither implementation supports a fork deadline; both Not-Bitcoin-XT and\nXT will produce blocks with those bits set indefinitely under any\ncircumstance, with the proviso that while XT has a hashing power\nmajority, blocks it produces might not be part of the Bitcoin blockchain\nafter Jan 11th 2016. (though this can flap back and forth if reorgs\nhappen)\n\nCuriously the BIP101 draft was changed(4) at the last minute from using\nthe nVersion bits compliant 0x20000004 block nVersion, to using two more\nbits unnecessarily. The rational for doing this is unknown; the git\ncommit message associated with the change suggested \"compatibility\nconcerns\", but what the concerns actually were isn't specified. Equally\neven though implementing the fork deadline would be very each in the XT\nimplementation, this was not done. (the XT codebase has had almost no\npeer review)\n\n\nOptions for CLTV/CSV/etc. deployment\n------------------------------------\n\n1) Plain IsSuperMajority() with nVersion=4\n\nThis option can be ruled out immediately due to the high risk of\npremature triggering, without genuine 95% miner support.\n\n\n2) nVersion mask, with IsSuperMajority()\n\nIn this option the nVersion bits set by XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT miners would\nbe masked away, prior to applying standard IsSuperMajority() logic:\n\n    block.nVersion & ~0x20000007\n\nThis means that CLTV/CSV/etc. miners running Bitcoin Core would create\nblocks with nVersion=8, 0b1000. From the perspective of the\nCLTV/CSV/etc.  IsSuperMajority() test, XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT miners would be\nadvertising blocks that do not trigger the soft-fork.\n\nFor the perpose of soft-fork warnings, the highest known version can\nremain nVersion=8, which is triggered by both XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT blocks\nas well as a future nVersion bits implementation. Equally,\nXT/Not-Bitcoin-XT soft-fork warnings will be triggered, by having an\nunknown bit set.\n\nWhen nVersion bits is implemented by the Bitcoin protocol, the plan of\nsetting the high bits to 0b001 still works. The three lowest bits will\nbe unusable for some time, but will be eventually recoverable as\nXT/Not-Bitcoin-XT mining ceases.\n\nEqually, further IsSuperMajority() softforks can be accomplished with\nthe same masking technique.\n\nThis option does complicate the XT-coin protocol implementation in the\nfuture. But that's their problem, and anyway, the maintainers\n(Hearn/Andresen) has strenuously argued(5) against the use of soft-forks\nand/or appear to be in favor of a more centralized mandatory update\nschedule.(6)\n\n\n3) Full nVersion bits implementation\n\nThe most complex option would be to deploy via full nVersion bits\nimplementation using flag bit #4 to trigger the fork. Compliant miners\nwould advertise 0x20000008 initially, followed by 0x20000000 once the\nfork had triggered. The lowest three bits would be unusable for forks\nfor some time, although they could be eventually recovered as\nXT/Not-Bitcoin-XT mining ceases.\n\nThe main disadvantage of this option is high initial complexity - the\nreason why IsSuperMajority() was suggested for CLTV/CSV in the first\nplace. That said, much of the code required has been implemented in XT\nfor the BIP101 hard-fork logic, although as mentioned above, the code\nhas had very little peer review.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1) https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt\n\n2) https://github.com/xtbit/notbitcoinxt\n\n3) \"Version bits proposal\",\n    Pieter Wuille, May 26th 2015, Bitcoin-development mailing list,\n    http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/008282.html,\n    https://gist.github.com/sipa/bf69659f43e763540550\n\n4) https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/3248c9f67bd7fcd1d05b8db7c5c56e4788deebfe\n\n5) \"On consensus and forks - What is the difference between a hard and soft fork?\",\n   Mike Hearn, Aug 12th 2015,\n   https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7\n\n6) 2013 San Jose Bitcoin conference developer round-table\n\n-- \n'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org\n00000000000000000402fe6fb9ad613c93e12bddfc6ec02a2bd92f002050594d\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 650 bytes\nDesc: Digital signature\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150818/b88cb49a/attachment.sig>"

So when this all clears up we haven't needlessly\n> wasted an additional bit.\n\nAh, I see your point now re: wasting bits; my post was a bit incorrect\non that point.\n\nSo a subtle thing with the IsSuperMajority() mechanism, and the nVersion\nbits proposal alternative, is one of the main objectives of the latter\nproposal proposal is to allow forks to *fail* to be adopted cleanly.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, consider a hypothetical CLTV soft-fork,\nimplemented with IsSuperMajority() nVersion >= 4. We release Bitcoin\nCore with that code, call it Bitcoin Core v0.12.0, however some\nsubstantial fraction of the mining community refuses to upgrade,\nbelieving CLTV to be a bad idea. This forms the community into Bitcoin\nCore and Bitcoin Not-CLTV camps. The Not-CLTV camp then wants to do a\nnew soft-fork upgrade, say for CHECKSIG2\n\nWhat now? If CHECKSIG2 is implemented via IsSuperMajority, nVersion >=\n5, that'll falsely trigger Core nodes to think the upgrade has gone\nthough. You could safely define >= 5 semantics to be \"OP_CLTV is now\ndisabled\", but that's pretty ugly and unnecessarily uses up a NOP.\n\nYou can avoid this problem by assigning one bit out of nVersion for\nevery soft-fork, but then you can only do ~29 more soft-forks - ugly!\n\n\nCome to think of it, if you're Really Sure\u2122 the soft-fork will be\nadopted, you can recycle those bits by using the following rule:\n\n    if (IsFlagBitMaskSuperMajority(1 << 4, pindex->pprev) || block.nMedianTime > CLTV_SOFTFORK_DEADLINE) {\n        flags |= SCRIPT_VERIFY_CLTV;\n    }\n\nIsFlagBitMaskSuperMajority() is a masked version of the existing\nIsSuperMajority() logic. CLTV_SOFTFORK_DEADLINE would be set some\nreasonable amount of time in the future, perhaps 3 years.\n\nThis would probably be ok for non-controversial forks - implementing\nDERSIG this way would have been fine - and an unlimited number of\nsoft-forks can be done this way safely. (even in parallel)\n\nHowever, this idea still causes problems if forks ever fail to get\nadoption, something the nVersion bits proposal handles cleanly, albeit\nat the cost of a significantly more complex implementation. With a\nsufficiently far off fork deadline in practice that may not be a big\nissue - nearly everyone would have upgraded their software anyway -  but\nit's still technically creating hard-fork scenarios with respect to\nolder software whenever forks fail to get adoption.\n\n-- \n'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org\n00000000000000000402fe6fb9ad613c93e12bddfc6ec02a2bd92f002050594d\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 650 bytes\nDesc: Digital signature\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150819/74bc1191/attachment-0001.sig>"

For example, for Electrum, bitcoin.org not only directs\nusers to wait 30 confirmations more than usual, but also directs users\nto the following resource:\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=July_2015_chain_forks&redirect=n\no\n\nThis brings me to the \"safe software and version.\"  If we understand\nthis correctly, the safe software and version will be Bitcoin Core at\nits most current version.  Thus it is vitally important to provide a\nway to ensure that users do not inadvertently be misled into\nconnecting to a XT node.\n\nHowever, the information (about the software and version, in banner)\nis provided voluntarily by the server administrators and thus isn't\nvalidated.  How to make sure that you are actually connecting to one\nwho is running Core with the proper version (and not Core with some\nvery old version, or XT)?\n\nOn the bitcoin wiki, it states in part,\n\"During a fork, it is possible to use the Get Block Header custom\nplugin[3] to authoritatively determine which side of the fork an\nElectrum server is on.\"  It refers to this:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1110912.msg11800126\n\nDepending on what wallet people are using, that is, Core, any of the\nother wallets... hardware, desktop, web, mobile... there would be\ndifferent ways to determine what software is being used to make sure\nthat you are using Core in the current version (and not inadvertently\nusing XT for example).  The question is, how would this be done most\neasily?\n\nThanks in advance for your answer(s).\n- -- \nhttp://abis.io ~\n\"a protocol concept to enable decentralization\nand expansion of a giving economy, and a new social good\"\nhttps://keybase.io/odinn\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1\n\niQEcBAEBAgAGBQJV1CakAAoJEGxwq/inSG8CLPUH/RnCMjGSFrPQc9wvRv9NWPYP\nMr+pzIBpiOXvikYXBT6cm/2AmmKhNmOjAHcdb9VrXPbk5ov/+odlcjGKeyXBc8zr\n6+FAhDrnmznL1TEn+DL1UUBQlonNf4MFK8YZBusslFA14lSCSywn9IdubPD3ONzc\n4f0uHl6c4wk0yLfmlJPbHevaEY/UdIyxPde2Nw+7IImWpdGJjBUiKTGb7/ZC4hTR\ndTWmKNKAiXpCd2om86jbo12WP0rgpv66P2DgeetPzv8/dwWoons3FUJL/+tveFlm\nSuTmjZWlDtzPm/56eTXUU64y7bSWYLrdQXxUk8zqzlYL5CJuVJ+1fi8OjwYYZH0=\n=4J93\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

I\nused to read the Wikipedia firehose of recent edits because I thought\nthat's how you were supposed to use the site. Edits per second eventually\nreached beyond any reasonable estimate of human capacity and then I\nrealized what was going on. Any sort of \"glorious future\" for bitcoin with\nhundreds of millions of users will also see this problem for future\ndevelopers, even if only 0.1% of that population are money-interested\nprogrammers then that's 100,000 programmers to work with. I would never\nwant to turn off this raw feed. Having said that, I am somewhat surprise\nthat nobody has taken to weekly summaries of research and development\nactivity. Summarizing recent work is a valuable task that others can engage\nin just by reading the mailing list and aggregating multiple thoughts\ntogether, similar to release notes. I was also expecting to see something\nlike \"individual developer's summaries of things they have found\ninteresting over the past 30-90 days or past year\" digging up arcane\ndetails from the mailing list archives, or more infrequent summaries of the\nother smaller batched review emails. Digest mode mailing list consumption\nis often recommended to those who are uninterested in dealing with low\nsignal-to-noise, but I suspect that summarizing activity would be more\nvaluable for this community, especially for the different cognitive niches\nthat have developed.\n\n- Bryan\nhttp://heybryan.org/\n1 512 203 0507\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150819/d8899f5a/attachment.html>"

There has been a\nfailure of consensus on how to fix the design flaw evinced by the block\nsize fiasco.\n\nOn 15 August 2015 at 18:43, Satoshi Nakamoto via bitcoin-dev <\nbitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of\nrelying solely on altruism.\n\nThis is the root cause of the disagreement. Not on what value the block\nsize should be set to, a symptom and red herring. The whole argument\nagainst a block size increase is the further reduction in the node count.\n\nTherefore it makes sense to focus all energies on solving the root cause if\nwe are to save Bitcoin in the short and long run. It is tempting to toy\nwith the idea that a superior cryptocurrency which fixes the flaws can\nsupplant Bitcoin while it dies, but there is significant merit in the\nsuspicion that if Bitcoin fails the whole idea of cryptocurrencies will die\nwith it for another generation.\n\nBelow I will outline my thoughts on how Bitcoin can be improved so that\nmore people will be incentivised to run nodes.\n\n1. The current incentive is run like a lottery.\n\nMining becomes more and more of a lottery the more value that Bitcoin\nacquires. Prudent and rational people don't partake in lotteries as the\nexpected payoff is negative. Due to rewards at the block level, this leads\nto a winner-takes-all situation, which leads to centralisation.\n\n2. Decentralised proof-of-work is equivalent to value.\n\nOn 15 August 2015 at 18:43, Satoshi Nakamoto via bitcoin-dev <\nbitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:\n> Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without\nbeing forced or pressured into it.\n\nProof-of-work is the basis of Bitcoin's security, which contributes to\nBitcoin's value. Further, the more decentralised that proof-of-work is, the\ngreater the value proposition of Bitcoin as a currency resistant to change\nby coercion.\n\n3. Importance of a public technical forum.\n\nIn order for there to be consensus, there must be a triumph of ideas over\npeople. Ideas are immortal, people are not. Also, pragmatism over idealism.\nThere must be no rank within the community, and no censorship or ignorance\nof others no matter their past contributions. However, it stands to reason\nthat those who are more educated and experienced should be taken more\nseriously than those who are not.\n\n4. Stronger ties between transaction validation and proof-of-work.\n\nAs pointed out, mining in the pooled sense can be done without doing any\nvalidation whatsoever. By tying mining with transaction validation, the two\nmust become inseparable.\n\nThe logical conclusion of this is that instead of mining blocks per se,\ntransactions must be mined individually.\n\n5. Fees to be paid to nodes.\n\nThe incentive to run nodes shall be made monetary. All the reward is\ncurrently going to those who do not really support the network.\n\n50% of a transaction's fee should go to the node that mined the transaction.\n\n6. The timechain.\n\nCurrently it is difficult to envisage anything other than grouping\ntransactions into blocks and timestamping them. The POW timestamping\nservice must have sufficient time gap between blocks.\n\nTherefore as transactions are mined each one will have the possibility to\nbecome a block in the timechain. The POW difficulty for a block will\nobviously be much greater than the POW required to mine a single\ntransaction.\n\nThis also requires every mined transaction to contain a block header, in\ncase it becomes a new block in the block chain. It will contain a prev\nblock hash, a merkle tree of mined transactions in the mempool, a nonce and\ntwo separate coinbase addresses. One coinbase output will be used to pay\nthe miner of the transaction, and the other will also pay the miner the\n(50%) transaction fees of the other transactions in the block, if the POW\non the transaction also satisfies the POW difficulty of a block.\n\n7. Transaction POW difficulty.\n\nBlock POW difficulty can remain as it currently does, to produce blocks at\napproximately 10 minute intervals.\n\nTransaction POW difficulty affects the rate at which mined transactions are\nproduced.\n\nNow, since each transaction contains a prev block hash an important\ndecision to make is whether to mandate that all transactions within a block\ncontain the same prev block hash, and that the prev block so referenced is\nthe immediate previous ancestor block, or whether any transaction may be\nadmitted into a block so long as the prev block referenced by the\ntransaction is any previous ancestor in the main chain.\n\nIf the former, then any transactions which don't make it into a block must\nbe re-mined for inclusion in the next block. Hence this more closely\nenforces the rate at which transactions are mined and included.\n\nThe rate at which transactions are mined and included in blocks is\nobviously proportional to the block size. The transaction POW difficulty\ncan be adjusted periodically so that the transaction rate or block size\nfollows a smooth trajectory and does not make any sudden jumps.\n\nGreater decentralisation of POW leads to increased mined transaction rate\n(given sufficient unmined transaction rate production). The inverse is also\ntrue. Hence transaction rate and block size is proportional to degree of\ndecentralisation.\n\n8. Miscalleneous observations.\n\nNodes only need work on transactions if they are valid.\n\nMined transactions are a weak guarantee that they will be accepted by the\nnetwork.\n\nThe originator of a transaction may self-mine his own transaction to avoid\npaying some of the fee.\n\nTransactions with higher fees and smaller size will be mined in preference.\n\nLarge block spam attack is expensive due to the POW needed to mine the\ngigantic number of transactions.\n\nDecentralisation of nodes is encouraged to be close to the location of real\ntransaction origination i.e. consumers. Unmined transactions may not be\nrelayed by a node if it chooses to work on it, if the fee is high enough.\n\nBlock-level reward is still a decentralised lottery. Transaction-level\nrewards go to those running the network. Fees will go up as it will be the\nnodes that are mining transactions that need to be individually\ncompensated, and not miners mining only block headers.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150819/596c37af/attachment.html>"

If Core supported bigger blocks, most XT\nusers would switch back to Core and XT would die.\n\n2.) In this high stakes game of poker, XT just went all in, but Core still\nhas the far better hand. There are many, many scaling solutions Core could\nadopt that would appease XT users enough to kill XT. Don't let perfect be\nthe enemy of good. The real question is whether or not anyone can provide\nenough Core leadership to reach \"consensus\". The longer it takes for Core\nto reach \"consensus\", the stronger XT gets.\n\n3.) Bitcoin market price has a far greater mining centralizing effect than\nlarger blocks ever will. Right now, miners with reasonably efficient\nhardware and energy costs (.5W/GH mining hardware, 10 cents per kilowatt\nhour power, $250 BTC price) spend about half of their mining income on\nelectricity. If the total Bitcoin market cap is under ~5 billion at the\nnext halving in July 2016, it's game over for all but the most efficient\n(large) miners. The mining centralization that may occur with 8MB blocks in\n2016 is nothing compared to the centralization that will occur if the total\nBitcoin market cap does not grow substantially between now and the next\nhalving.\n\n4.) Investors hate uncertainty, and the blocksize issue is adding a lot of\nuncertainty right now, which makes the mining nightmare scenario outlined\nabove more likely. The entire ecosystem needs time to adjust and grow once\na Core scaling solution is adopted. Hopefully this issue will be revolved\nwell before the next halving in July 2016 so the market has time to adjust\nand grow again.\n\n5.) Not-BitcoinXT is a really terrible idea. Mike has proven time and time\nagain that he will not blink or back down. The chances of Not-BitcoinXT\ngaining 25% of the hashrate are pretty much nil, so in effect, all\nNot-BitcoinXT will do is help XT reach the 75% threshold sooner and end up\nputting more people on the losing side of the fork.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150819/a69e5e4c/attachment.html>"

I now\nunderstandbetter  your position of having your own repository until a\ncomplete libconsensus is separated.\nIn the meantime you will have to keep using your re-implementation of\nthe rest of the consensus rules (besides the script checks), but\nfortunately the most risky and harder reimplementation is the part of\nthe script validation.\n\n> My question is why you would not embrace an independent consensus\n> repository? Your work to evolve it doesn't change.\n\nYes, I want a separated repository. I just wanted to start with a\nseparated folder first. Right now there's consensus code all over the\nplace, specially in main.cpp.\nI think changing the order (separated repository first, moving code\nfrom Bitcoin Core to libconsensus later) would increase the total\namount of work.\n\nHere's another option that has recently crossed my mind:\n\n1) Finish the libconsensus separation in an independent branch on top\nof a given version, for example 0.11.\n2) Separate a repository from that. Alternative implementations can\nstart using a full libconsensus\n3) Rebase that branch on top of bitcoin/master and start to PR small\ngroups of commits. Once the whole branch has been merged, Bitcoin Core\ncan replace the consensus folder with the libconsensus subtree, so\nthat Bitcoin Core itself can start using a full libconsensus.\n\nIronically with this plan Bitcoin Core may not be the full node first\nimplementation to use a full libconsensus.\nThere will be some consensus fork bug risks during 3 (which at the\ncurrent speed I estimate it could easily take 3 or 4 years) and there\nwould be some redundant work (replicating every consensus change in\nboth Bitcoin Core and libconsensus).\nOn the bright side, we may be able to have a full libconsensus this\nyear (which was my goal after we exposed VerifyScript in the first\nlibconsensus).\n\nThoughts?"

It would actually be lower quality because of the antique tool set.\n\nThe rules outside script engine are simpler, therefore much easier to capture exactly. They are however\nscattered around in the spaghetti and are often just a single if statement, also repeated elsewhere.\n\nYou would either have to very extensively refactor the code, that unlikely goes through as a PR, or\ndo what me and others did.

One of\nthe goals is to have as little dependencies as possible (so \"more\nmodern tool sets\" may not be suitable for libconsensus). libsecp256k1\nwill keep on being a dependency (highly optimized C code) and that's\nabout it.\nIdeally I would like to slowly move libconsensus from C++ to C too,\nbut it seems other people would prefer to move to C++11 instead.\n\n> The rules outside script engine are simpler, therefore much easier to\n> capture exactly. They are however\n> scattered around in the spaghetti and are often just a single if statement,\n> also repeated elsewhere.\n\nYes, they are simpler and thus there's less risks of consensus fork\nbugs, but it still exists.\nIt is true that the consensus code is currently spread all around\n(specially in main.cpp), but completing libconsensus would solve that.\nLastly, since for consensus rules \"the code is the specification\", it\nis unfortunate that the specification is coupled with a concrete\nimplementation (Bitcoin Core) and we should fix that.\n\n> You would either have to very extensively refactor the code, that unlikely\n> goes through as a PR, or\n> do what me and others did. Read satoshi code and rewrite the same. You have\n> a slight advantage of copy-paste small fragments, but I doubt the consensus\n> relevant advantage of that.\n\nBut the goal is not reimplementing the consensus rules but rather\nextract them from Bitcoin Core so that nobody needs to re-implement\nthem again.\nIt is not only exposing it but also separating it from Bitcoin Core so\nthat they can be changed without having to also change/take into\naccount non-consensus Bitcoin Core specific things.\nA single PR would certainly be unacceptable, I was making many little\nmore acceptable ones (some of them already merged):\n\n* [1/9] Consensus\n** MERGED or DELETED\n*** MERGED Consensus: Decouple pow from chainparams #5812 [consensuspow]\n*** MERGED MOVEONLY: Move constants and globals to consensus.h #5696\n[consensus_policy0]\n*** DELETED Refactor: Create CCoinsViewEfficient interface for\nCCoinsViewCache #5747 [coins]\n*** MERGED Chainparams: Refactor: Decouple IsSuperMajority from\nParams() #5968 [params_consensus]\n*** MERGED Remove redundant getter\nCChainParams::SubsidyHalvingInterval() #5996 [params_subsidy]\n*** MERGED Separate CValidationState from main #5669 [consensus]\n*** DELETED Consensus: Refactor: Separate CheckFinalTx from\nmain::IsFinalTx #6063 [consensus_finaltx]\n*** MERGED Consensus: Decouple ContextualCheckBlockHeader from\ncheckpoints #5975 [consensus_checkpoints]\n*** MERGED Separate Consensus::CheckTxInputs and GetSpendHeight in\nCheckInputs #6061 [consensus_inputs]\n*** MERGED Bugfix: Don't check the genesis block header before\naccepting it #6299 [5975-quick-fix]\n** REBASE Chainparams: Explicit Consensus::Params arg in consensus\nfunctions #6024 [params_consensus2]\n** REBASE Optimizations: Consensus: In AcceptToMemoryPool,\nConnectBlock, and CreateNewBlock #6445 [consensus-txinputs-0.12.99]\n** REBASE MOVEONLY: Move most of consensus functions (pre-block) #6051\n[consensus_moveonly]\n** REBASE Consensus: Refactor: Turn CBlockIndex::GetMedianTimePast\ninto independent function #6009 [consensus_mediantime]\n** DEPENDENT Consensus: Refactor: Consensus version of\nCheckBlockHeader() #6035 [consensus_checkblockheader]\n** DEPENDENT Consensus: Consensus version of pow functions [consensus_pow2]\n** DEPENDENT API: Expose bitcoinconsensus_verify_header() in\nlibconsensus #5995 [consensus_header]\n** DEPENDENT API: Expose bitcoinconsensus_verify_block() in\nlibconsensus #5946 [consensus_tip]"

                "message_text_only": "I completely agree and I share your frustration.\nThe importance of modularization is often disregarded but in my\nopinion it has a deep positive impact in the long term: more people\nare able to contribute with code and review (in the areas they know\nbetter), the risks associated with each change become more clear\n(there was a time when almost any change implied consensus risks),\nmore alternative code bases can be implemented on top of the basic\nones without fear of consensus bugs, etc.\n\nWhen I first read some of the code in 2011, I concluded that almost\neverything was in main.cpp (which I found ridiculous from a software\nengineering perspective). When I started to contribute with code in\n2014, main.cpp was still (and still is in my opinion) giant, but the\nmodularization had greatly improved thanks to changes like moving the\nserialization code out of main (thank you very much for that). We\nstill have a lot of work ahead, but we've certainly advanced a lot.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot force reviewers to pay more attention to\nmodularization PRs, many of them are usually more interested in\nchanges that add or remove functionality in the short term. This\nproblem gets exacerbated when modularization changes are required to\nbe done in small increments to make them more easily reviewable and\nless disruptive to other open PRs, since it's harder for people to see\nthe big picture and the rationale for those small changes (that often\ndon't hcange functionality or performance at all).\n\nI know we are not alone on this and people like Wladimir, Pieter, Cory\nand Jonas Schnelli (at least, probably more people do) deeply care\nabout modularization, even if I subjectively and selfishly interpret\nthe lack of review on some of my PRs as a symptom of the opposite.\nSo I suggest that people who think this is a high priority join and\nreview each other's PRs on the subject.\n\nCurrently I focus on 3 modularization areas:\n\n1) Chainparams: supporting multiple chains (ie multiple testchains is\nall what Bitcoin cares about) is a great goal but there's still many\nbarriers to create a new testchain. I started this work with #3824,\nbut even after #6382 there are still more things to do.\n\n2) Consensus: separating the consensus code, Matt Corallo had the idea\nof also exposing it in libconsensus. I started with #3839, the latest\nthings I still have open are #6591 and #6445, please review.\n\n3) Policy: separate node local policy code. Luke Dashjr started with\n#5071, I started with #6335 (after several failed attempts), the next\nlittle step blocking many other changes I have ready for way too long\nis #6068 (#6424 also helps), please review.\n\nI know Jonas Schnelli is focusing on the wallet. Cory Fields has\nrecently focused on checkpoints and chainparams.\n\nNow that I know that you also care about modularization I will ask you\nfor review as well, I hope not to be too annoying like I've been with\nWladimir and Cory some times (and I usually am with some of my\ncoworkers at blockstream). Please do the same with me: point me to any\nmodularization PR you have opened.\n\nRegarding your next post, I agree that an additional \"Layer\" field in\nBIPs could be useful. Maybe you should start a BIP for that?\n\nOn Sun, Aug 23, 2015 at 3:23 AM, Eric Lombrozo <elombrozo at gmail.com> wrote:\n> I've been pushing for greater modularization since I first got into bitcoin.\n> I got quickly frustrated when I was only able to get through very few things\n> (i.e. moving core structure serialization classes to a separate unit not\n> called main).

Maybe, I'm\nnot sure it makes sense, maybe it's just simpler to maintain a\ndifferent project for each different chain (ie libfreicoinconsensus,\nlibbetaconsensus, etc).\n\n> I integrated libconsensus only for the hope that is significantly fastens\n> application side tx verification,\n>  which it has turned out it does not, until secp265k1 is integrated.\n\nThat is very sad to hear. The main reason to integrate libconsensus is\nto avoid consensus fork bugs (or to not depend on the \"border routers\"\nto avoid those bugs).\n\n> I would likely use an other extended libconsensus too, but do not think\n> there was a dependency on\n> that for enterprise development.\n>\n> It would help there more to have a slim protocol server, no wallet, no rpc,\n> no qt but a high\n> performance remoting API.\n\nThat's out of scope for libconsensus which will be stateless and whose\nonly API would be in C.\nBut the refactors in Bitcoin Core will hopefully make it easier to\nsupport such a minimal node in it (you know you can \"./configure\n--disable-wallet --without-gui\" already, right?, about RPC, that's the\nremaining API!).\n\n> Since you already depend on libconsensus for VerifyScript, wouldn't it\n> be nice that it also offered VerifyTx, VerifyHeader and VerifyBlock?\n> You would still have complete control over storage, concurrency,\n> networking, policy...\n> My plan is for the C API to interface with the external storage by\n> passing a function pointer to it.\n>\n>\n> Storage and validation is non-trivially interconnected, but I now the\n> separation can be done,\n> since I did it.\n>\n> Excuse me, but function pointers is a pattern I used in the 80\u2019s.

                "message_text_only": "Hello,\n\nFor sake of peace, I wanted to give a chance to XT's block size growth efforts \nby actually *reading* BIP101 [1] which seems to be their specification.\nThus, please read this mail as something which aims to establish peaceful \ncooperation between the non-XT and XT community; not as something which wants \nto brush off BIP101 :)\n\nPlease also be aware that I am an outside non-Bitcoin developer, and thus \njudge the document merely from the stuff which it actually contains, not from \ndiscussions during its development.\nI hope this actually allows increased objectivity: A scientific document \nsuch as BIP101 should be fully self-contained.\n\nBIP101 proposes this:\n> The maximum size shall be 8,000,000 bytes at a timestamp of 2016-01-11\n> 00:00:00 UTC (timestamp 1452470400), and shall double every 63,072,000\n> seconds (two years, ignoring leap years), until 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC\n> (timestamp 2083190400). The maximum size of blocks in between doublings\n> will increase linearly based on the block's timestamp. The maximum size of\n> blocks after 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC shall be 8,192,000,000 bytes.\n\nI.e. a fixed function instead of adaptive, demand-based growth.\nLet us for a moment give the benefit of doubt and blindly assume that a fixed \nfunction is better than the adaptive growth which I advocated [2].\n\nIf we ignore the reasons [3] behind the choice of the initial value of 8MB \nfor simplicity, what this function aims to model is this:\n> The doubling interval was chosen based on long-term growth trends for CPU\n> power, storage, and Internet bandwidth. The 20-year limit was chosen\n> because exponential growth cannot continue forever. If long-term trends do\n> not continue, maximum block sizes can be reduced by miner consensus (a\n> soft-fork).\n\nSo you're trying to match a natural process of resource growth with a bounded \nexponential growth function. I would blind-guess the natural growth to be \nsomething like [4] or [5]. Your function is not symmetrical, so it is for sure \nnot aims to be [4], rather maybe close to [5] ?\n\nLet us blindly assume it is a honorable and adequate way of limiting resource \nusage to try to limit usage of a resource (= block size) to a function which \nmatches measured natural supply of the resource (= available CPU / storage / \nnetwork as the proposed function aims to model).\nWe can probably all say that this is a standard scientific behavior, and used \nin many systems.\n\nNow what is also the mathematical / scientific standard is this:\nIf you aim to match a natural dataset with a model function of it, you \nprovide:\n\n1) a plot of the measurements of the natural data you're trying to match. \nI.e. you plot your source data behind \"based on long-term growth trends for \nCPU power, storage, and Internet bandwidth\". I am unable to locate such a plot \nin the BIP101 document; and also not a link to the raw source data. Can you \nplease provide at least the raw data, if not a plot?\n\n2) a plot of your model function. Also cannot find this in BIP101. Can you \nplease provide it?\n\n3) a joined plot of 1 and 2. This is what will prove whether your model is \nadequate: If the source data and your model function match, it is. This is the \ncentral thing I am missing in BIP101.\n\nI would be happy if you could provide the plots, or at least the raw data. I \nwould love to offer help with GnuPlot, but this will take some weeks [6].\n\nLet me stress further possible mathematical problems which show why the plots \nare important for deciding whether BIP101 is a good idea:\n\nOnce we have a plot of the functions, the central question will be this:\nHas the natural source data sufficiently revealed its saturation curve so we \ncan guess its defining constants?\nThis is important because: While the logistic function [4] seems to be \nsymmetrical, and thus the constants are revealed without nature reaching \nsaturation yet, it is quite possible that the natural growth of CPU / disk / \nnetwork is rather a generalised logistic function [5] which is not \nsymmetrical. Then we would have to wait until saturation starts so we can \nguess the constants needed to model it.\n\nThus, if natural growth has not reached the beginning of saturation yet, and \nthe saturation curve cannot be guessed, it is questionable of whether BIP101 \nis adequate: It is then possible that natural saturation is slower than \nBIP101-saturation (= more resources will be available than consumed), and in \nthe future we will reach a situation where blocks are smaller than the natural \ncapacity again.\nThen the whole discussion to increase block size will happen again - but \npossibly with a much larger economy behind Bitcoin, and thus much less \npossibility of reaching consensus.\n\nThus, in conclusion, please:\n- provide plots, or at least data.\n- once you have the plots, be open to scientifically admit that BIP101 might \nbe insufficient if the plots show the open questions I have just elaborated. I \nam also open to admitting that your data is sufficient from what I can say \n:)\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am in no way good at math. Hence please only use my elaborations \nto disprove stuff, not to prove it.\n\n\nGreetings,\n\txor, a developer for the anonymous P2P network https://freenetproject.org/\n       (while it existed for 16 years, we only have 3 months of funding left,\n        so please excuse me abusing this publicity to say that we accept\n        Bitcoin donations :)\n\n\n[1] \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/a409100854f52454b0ba30f98f8f5e585695ec0e/bip-0101.mediawiki\n\n[2] http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010262.html\n\n[3]\n> The initial size of 8,000,000 bytes was chosen after testing the current\n> reference implementation code with larger block sizes and receiving\n> feedback from miners on bandwidth-constrained networks (in particular,\n> Chinese miners behind the Great Firewall of China).\nNotice: Similar to what is said in the main part of the mail about data and \nplots, it would be nice to provide source data and plots for this as well.\n\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\n\n[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function\n\n[6] I'm busy with finishing my bachelor's thesis for the next two weeks, which \nis rather very important to me :) Afterwards, I am willing to help with \nGnuPlot.

Nodes should be\ndoing caching and proper gossip protocol participation whenever\npossible. (note how bitcoinj nodes *do* rely on centralized servers,\nimplemented with an unauthenticated, unencrypted, protocol - the worst\nof all possible solutions with many possible MITM vectors and privacy\nsecurity holes)\n\nTo that end, I'd be inclined to leave the DNS seed protocol as it is and\nlet others solve the centralized server use-case, for which Cartographer\nisn't all that bad of a load balancing mechanism. Also as gmaxwell noted\non IRC, adding flag bits does have privacy implications.\n\n> Re: need to \"shard\" the blockchain: not sure what you're referring to\n> here. The bloom filter stuff requires you to download the chain\n> in-order, sure, but you have to do that for headers anyway, and\n> hopefully your total data isnt too much more than headers alone.\n\nAny protocol change that would split blocks themselves into multiples.\nNot an easy problem to solve, but given the inherent O(n^2) scaling of\nglobal consensus blockchains, it's the only kind of solution that could\nin the future make the blockchain itself have reasonable scalability.\n\n> Anyone have the best reference for the DoS issues?\n\nWell actually, we can reference the DoS attacks that Bitcoin XT nodes\nare undergoing right now - part of the attack is repeated Bloom filter\nrequests to soak up disk IO bandwidth. I've CC'd Gavin and Mike - as far\nas I know they haven't published details of those attacks - a write-up\nwould be very helpful.\n\nWhile so far those are being directed only at XT nodes, obviously this\nis a potential issue for Core nodes as well. Like I mentioned last time\naround, it's critical that miners aren't affected by these attacks -\nnodes simply serving SPV wallet clients are much less latency sensitive,\nso a good DoS attack mitigation strategy would be to have the two\nclasses of nodes out there \"in the wild\"\n\n> BIP: ?\n> Title: NODE_BLOOM service bit\n> Author: Matt Corallo <bip at bluematt.me>, Peter Todd <pete at petertodd.org>\n> Type: Standards Track (draft)\n> Created: 20-08-2015\n> \n> Abstract\n> ========\n> \n> This BIP extends BIP 37, Connection Bloom filtering, by defining a\n> service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support bloom filters\n> explicitly.

The measures did not protect\nagainst malicious attempts to trigger the the fork.\n\nLitecoin is no different. Because of that I strongly recomend that miners be\nencouraged to transition to v0.8.3.6 as soon as possible to ensure as much\nhashing power as possible is consolidated on one version. Transitioning for\nusers/merchants is also important, however with sufficient mining power on the\nnew version it would be difficult to pull off a double-spend attack against an\nolder version simply because it would take so long to get the required number\nof confirmations.\n\nThe development team may want to clarify this point to the Litecoin community\nand encourage users to be suspicious if it takes an especially long time to get\nconfirmations. Merchants with automatic systems should use fail-safes triggered\nby unusually long confirmation times, and as always ensure that total possible\nlosses are limited. It would be good if popular \"blockchain information\" sites\nupgraded to v0.8.3.6 along with miners to give users accurate information on\nthe state of the blockchain. In any case users and merchants should take this\nadvice in general regardless of specific threats.\n\nI would not be surprised to see someone deliberately attempt to fork Litecoin\nby exploiting the issue; there is a lot of hostility torwards and within the\nalt-coins.\n\n\nSPV and network-wide DoS attacks\n================================\n\nBitcoin is quite vulnerable currently to network-wide DoS attacks due to the\nmaximum connections limits; we do not have any form of filtering on incoming\nconnections so an attack can be made simply by making sufficient connections to\nall nodes that they hit that incoming connections limit. This is public\nknowledge, as is the suggestion to stop the attack by having concepts of peer\n\"usefullness\" so that \"useless\" peers can be dropped. Of course SPV nodes are\nbadly impacted by such measures.\n\nWhat isn't as well-known publicly is that Litecoin will make this attack\nsignificantly less costly to the attacker in v0.8.3.6 by adding support for\nbloom filters. That support allows the attacker to reduce their bandwidth\nconsumption to a minimum, making the attack easier to pull off on a wide scale.\n\nThe Bitcoin team is aware of the issue. Our plans in the event of an attack are\nto ensure that large pools and merchants connect to each other via a private\n\"darknet\" while fixes are implemented. These plans are also useful in the event\nof an attack exploiting the vulnerability discussed below.\n\n\nBloom filters and disk IO\n=========================\n\nHowever it gets worse: there is nothing limiting peers from requesting blocks.\nWithout bloom filters bandwidth is a natural limit, however with bloom filters\na malicious peer can simply set the filter to match almost nothing and simply\nsubmit getdata messages to the target requesting all blocks. The target will do\nan extremely large amount of disk IO at almost no cost to the attacker.\n\nTo quote one core developer in a private conversation regarding bloom filtering\n\"I think we didn't think hard enough before implementing this\"\n\nA good first measure would be to assign a service bit to advertise bloom filter\nsupport:\n\n /** nServices flags */\n enum\n {\n     NODE_NETWORK = (1 << 0),\n+    NODE_BLOOM_FILTER = (1 << 1),\n };\n\nSecondly add a command line switch that allows bloom filtering to be turned on\nor off entirely. I would suggest that the next version of Litecoin be released\nsoon and have bloom filters *disabled* by default unless the user specifically\nturns them on.\n\nThere is a *very* good chance of an attack being launched targetting this\nvulnerability by people using it as a way to show their opinion of Mike Hearn;\nlots of people strongly dislike him for what they regard as very poor judgement\non security and scalability issues and would be happy to show that a design he\npromoted is flawed.\n\nDisabling bloom filering does of course cause problems for SPV clients, however\nin the Litecoin realm such clients are non-existent. In the long run DNS seeds\nshould allow for the specification of desired service bits and rate limiting of\ngetdata operations implemented. However given that attacks are likely imminent\nI strongly suggest a quick solution.\n\nBitcoin should have done bloom filtering as a service bit on day one; not doing\nso was a mistake.\n\nThe Bitcoin team is aware of this issue. Please contact me to discuss the\nrelease process for a fix; I will also be happy to review it. Unfortunately due\nto the impact on SPV clients this issue is political as well as technical on\nthe Bitcoin side of things.\n\n\nCHECKMULTISIG dummy value\n=========================\n\nThe AreInputsStandard() test does not check the contents of the dummy value\nrequired to spend a BIP11 CHECKMULTISIG scriptPubKey; anything that be put in\nthat space as a way to get data into the blockchain. Less well appreciated is\nthat because scriptSigs are unsigned any node, even a non-miner, can change the\ntxid of a CHECKMULTISIG transaction by modifying the dummy value.\n\nThis issue will probably be fixed in Bitcoin soon, not to mention revealed\npublically; I'm only including it for the sake of completeness.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 650 bytes\nDesc: Digital signature\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150821/d43573b7/attachment.sig>"

                "message_text_only": "NACK: stated rationales are invalid: both privacy and DoS (see below for\nexperimental data).\n\n\n1 - Bloom filtering doesn't add privacy for node operators, it adds privacy\nfor lightweight wallets. And in fact, with a high FP rate it does do that.\nMost users want both low bandwidth usage *and* query scrambling, which is\nharder to do but not impossible. There is a clear roadmap for how to\nimplement that with smarter clients: no protocol changes are needed.\n\nSo the first stated rationale is spurious: disabling Bloom filtering\ndoesn't improve privacy for anyone. It can only hurt.\n\n\n\n2 - SPV usage is rising, not falling.\n\nPeter's data is flawed because he ignored the fact that SPV clients tend to\nconnect, sync, then disconnect. They don't remain connected all the time.\nSo merely examining a random snapshot of what's connected at a single point\nin time will give wildly varying and almost random results.\n\nA more scientifically valid approach is to check the number of actual\nconnections over a long span of time. Here's the data from my node:\n\nmike at plan99:~/.bitcoin$ grep -Po 'receive version message: ([^:]*):'\ndebug.log |sort |uniq -c|sort -n|tac|head -n 10\n  11027 receive version message: /getaddr.bitnodes.io:\n   6264 receive version message: /bitcoinseeder:\n   4944 receive version message: /bitcoinj:\n   2531 receive version message: /Snoopy:\n   2362 receive version message: /breadwallet:\n   1127 receive version message: /Satoshi:\n    204 receive version message: /Bitcoin XT:\n    128 receive version message: /BitCoinJ:\n     97 receive version message: /Bither1.3.8/:\n     82 receive version message: /Bitaps:\n\nOnce crawlers are removed, SPV wallets (bitcoinj, breadwallet) make up the\nbulk of all P2P clients. This is very far from 1% and falling, as Todd\nwrongly suggests.\n\n\n\n3 - It is said that there is a DoS attack possible. This claim does not\nseem to have been researched.\n\nI decided to test it out for real, so I implemented a DoS attack similar to\nthe one we've seen against XT nodes: it sends getdata for large (1mb)\nfiltered blocks over and over again as fast as possible.\n\nAs was reported and makes sense, CPU usage goes to 100%. However I couldn't\nsee any other effects. RPCs still react immediately, the Qt GUI is fully\nresponsive, I was even able to sync another SPV client to that node and it\nproceeded at full speed. It's actually pretty nice to see how well it held\nup.\n\nMost importantly transactions and blocks continued to be relayed without\ndelay. I saw my VPS node receive a block only eight seconds after my local\nnode, which is well within normal propagation delays.\n\nThere's another very important point here: I profiled my local node whilst\nit was under this attack. It turns out that Bloom filtering is extremely\nfast. 90% of the CPU time is spent on loading and deserializing the data\nfrom disk. Only 10% of the CPU time was spent actually filtering.\n\nThus you can easily trigger exactly the same DoS attack by just using\nregular getdata requests on large blocks over and over. You don't need\nBloom filtering. If you don't want to actually download the blocks just\ndon't TCP ACK the packets and then FIN after a few seconds .... the data\nwill all have been loaded and be sitting in the send buffers.\n\nSo even if I refine the attack and find a way to actually deny service to\nsomeone, the fix would have to apply to regular non-filtered block fetches\ntoo, which cannot be disabled.\n\n\nIn summary: this BIP doesn't solve anything, but does create a big upgrade\nheadache.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150824/ece22a74/attachment.html>"

A few anonymous people control both these forums, giving them unprecedented power to manipulate discussion, alter reputation, ban users, and even to facilitate scammers in the name of getting profits. Protecting the de-centralized spirit of the Bitcoin community is no longer on their list of priorities, in fact those in charge have publicly stated centralization is necessary. It doesn't matter how many thousands of posts you contributed or if you've traded thousands of Bitcoins, if one of the few who control reddit and bitcointalk decide to get rid of you there's nothing you can do. Bitcointalk has done more damage to my reputation than any other website I've ever used, and I only used it for a year. The damage wasn't even from the scammers, but rather those in charge of the community posting false allegations with zero evidence, and enforcing a guilty until proven innocent policy. Even when such allegations are definitively proven incorrect and allegations cease the posts stay on the internet forever, another site crawls all the bitcoin discussion and saves it. It's not an isolated incident either, happened several times to me before I realized how detrimental it was to even post there, and I've seen countless other members receive the same treatment. \n\nThere is no doubt that the centralization and censorship of the Bitcoin community is massively inhibiting the advance of Bitcoin and also the growth of the Bitcoin economy. We are scaring away intellectuals, businessman, and newbies that are just getting started. It has put us in a very dangerous position, the community has been weakened, and there is the possibility that the forums could be handed over to the government at any time due to their centralized nature.  \n\nI am creating a de-centralized forum, and I mean truly de-centralized as I nor anyone else will be able to control it. I am already writing the code and I'm confident it won't be long until a basic release is out. I am certain this will be very positive for the Bitcoin community, and the rest of the world since centralization is getting stronger everyday. The world needs this to level the playing field, it will be impossible for anything to be deleted on this forum even if the NSA attacks it. No one will be banned ever. The only rule is there are no rules.  \n\nIf anyone is interested in this feel free to email me back.

However he decided to make an alt coin and didn't use the real blockchain, which makes his network weak. It's a waste to not take advantage of the immense bitcoin computing power for this. I'm only planning on storing hashes in the blockchain though to prevent data bloat, and the parallel program which stores all the data will be a lot like twister. Additionally I'm going to take it beyond a messaging system, will be able to literally upload anything and everything to this system. Theres no limit to what this de-centralized system can do if designed correctly. Crypto graffiti has given a taste of that by uploading jpeg and png to the blockchain. \n\nWill be working on this 24/7 until the first release, will definitely tell you and others when the code is ready to be looked over.

As the block rewards get smaller, so will large\nminer advantages. An easy way to think about this is as follows:\n\nCurrently, the main critique of larger blocksizes is that we'll connected\nminers can cut out smaller miners by gratuitously filling up blocks with\nself-paying transactions. This only works because block subsidies exist.\nThe moment block rewards become comparable to block TX fees, this exploit\nceases to be functional.\n\nBasically, large miners will still be forced to move full blocks, but it\nwill go against their interest to fill them with spam since their main\nsource of income is the fees themselves. As a result, large miners (unlike\nsmaller ones) will lose the incentive to mine an un full block this evening\nthe playing field.\n\nIn this context, large blocksizes as proposed by BIP100-101 hope to\nstimulate the increase of TX fees by augmenting the network's capacity. The\nsooner block rewards become comparable to block fees, the sooner we will\nget rid of mine centralization.\n\nDpinna\n\n[1]\nhttp://www.scribd.com/mobile/doc/273443462/A-Transaction-Fee-Market-Exists-Without-a-Block-Size-Limit\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150821/46bb14ef/attachment.html>"

Larger miners cannot force their wishes so easily\nbecause not only will they have to pay extra a difficulty target, then can be\ndownvoted at no cost by the objecting hash power.\n\nUsing difficulty as a penalty is better than a fixed cost in bitcoins because it\nis less predictable.\n\n\n==Specification==\n\nThe initial block size limit shall be 1MB.\n\nEach time a miner creates a block, they may vote to increase or decrease the\nblocksize by a maximum of 10% of the current block size limit.

I chose to omit it from the proposal\nto see if it would come up during peer review.\n\nI feel that giving miners a blank cheque to increase blocksize, by any\nmeans, goes against a key design of bitcoin's security model. Full\nnodes keep miners honest by ensuring by validating their blocks. Under\nany voting-only scheme there is no way for full nodes to keep miners\nin cheque because miner have free reign to increase the blocksize.\n\nThis problem can be solved by introducing a hard cap on blocksize. By\nintroducing an upper limit miners now have the freedom to increase\nblocksize but only within defined parameters.  Remember my proposal\nallows blocksize to increase and decrease in such a way that miners\nmust collectively agree if they want the size to increase.\n\nI believe the idea of a hard upper limit has become rather politicised\nbut is essential to the security model of bitcoin.\n\nWith respect to the flexicap idea where miners can create a larger\nblock by paying extra difficulty, I believe that proposal has a\ncritical flaw because, as Gavin pointed out, it makes it very\nexpensive (and risky) to include a few extra transactions. I believe\nit suffers from tragedy of the commons because there is no incentive\nfor the mining community to reach consensus. Each and every block is\ngoing to be a gamble, \"should we include a few extra transactions at\nthe risk of losing the block?\".

                "message_text_only": "My current idea:\n\n* There's a scheduled hardcap that goes up over time.\n\n* Miners vote on the blocksize limit within the hardcap, choosing the new\nvotecap. No particular idea for scheduling change. The 2016 block period\nseems a bit long though, in case of sudden peak load.\n(I'd suggest rolling vote over X blocks, enacted Y blocks later (with votes\ncounted from block A to block B = block A+X, the change is enacted at block\nC = B+Y = A+X+Y). I'm fine with fixed-period schedules too if they span a\nreasonable time, such as IMHO 2 days - we need rapid peak adjustment. No\nsuggestion on vote result calculation mechanism.)\n\n* Casting votes are free.\n\n* The mean (average) blocksize over the last time period X is calculated\nfor every block, or at the end of every fixed-length period (depending on\nwhat scheduling is used for votes).\n\n* Creating blocks larger than the mean but below the votecap raises the\ndifficulty target for the miner (and slightly raises the mean for future\nblocks).\n\n* The degree of difficulty raise depends on where between the mean and\nvotecap that the size of the given block is (and it follows that lots of\nvotes for large raise reduces per-extra-Kb penalty, allowing for cheaper\npeak load adjustment if a large miner majority agrees). The degree of\nincrease may be either linear or logarithmic, I've got no suggestion\ncurrently on any particular metric.\n(Some might think this is an easy way for miners to collude to make large\nblocks cheaper. If so, you could commit to only pay fee to miners that\ndon't vote for a block size above the size you accept, as a\ncounter-incentive.)\n\n* Question: When the votecap is lowered, should the calculated mean be\nforced down to follow (forcing a penalty for making blocks close to the\nvotecap straight after the change)? If so, how? Or should it be allowed to\nfall naturally as new blocks with size below the votecap are created?\n\nThis is how miners would pay for actually creating larger blocks, and\nleaves us with three methods of keeping the size in check (hardcap, votecap\nand softcap). The softcap mechanism is then our third check to use if\ndeemed necessary (orphaning valid blocks if considered problematically\nlarge). This third option do not need coordination with miners, they just\nneed to be aware which block size is accepted by the community.\n\nI can't think of any sensible non-miner mechanism of deciding max block\nsize outside of using a community coordinated softcap, anything else will\nnot work reliably. Too hard to measure objectively and judge fairly.\n\nThe community would thus agree on a hardcap schedule in advance, and have\nthe option to threaten orphaning blocks via softfork later on if\ncircumstances would change and the votecap is too large.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150829/a985f3e6/attachment.html>"

BTCChina supports BIP100 and will vote for 2MB at the beginning, with \n8MB as a mid-term goal: \nhttps://vip.btcchina.com/page/noticetemplate?id=100.\nBTCChina is controlling 12% of the network in the past month. If BIP100 \nuses the 20-percentile vote as the block size, it takes only 8% more \nvote to keep the size at 2MB\n\nFor many reasons miners may want to have a smaller block size, which we \ndon't need to list them here. Although they can limit it by a softfork \nor even 51% attack, it is a very violent process. Why don't we just \nallow them to vote for a lower limit?\n\nSo I think the right way is to choose a mining-centralization-safe \nlimit, and let it free float within a range based on miner's vote. If we \nare lucky enough to have some responsible miners, they will keep it as \nlow as possible, until the legitimate tx volume catches up. Even in the \nworst case, the block size is still mining-centralization-safe. The \nupper limit may increase linearly, if not exponentially, until we find a \nbetter long-term solution. (sort of a combination of BIP100 and 101, \nwith different parameters)\n\n--------\nFor the matter of \"urgency\", I agree with you that there is no actual \nurgency AT THIS MOMENT.

We have \ndebated for 5 years. Why won't we have 5 more years of debate, plus 5 \nyears of deployment delay? Are we sticking to 1MB for 10 years?

I'm focusing on what they CAN do,\nwhile suspending judgement on their good will and not trying to\npredict their future behavior from historic behaviour.\nWith 60% of the hashrate, you can easily get 100% by orphaning\neverybody else's blocks. More importantly, being under the same\njurisdiction they can be forced to behave in certain way (for example,\ncensor transactions) by law.\nI'm very worried about the current situation no matter how benevolent\ncurrent miners are. Thus weakening the only limit to mining\ncentralization that we have at the consensus rule level seems\nextremely risky at this point.\n\n> For many reasons miners may want to have a smaller block size, which we\n> don't need to list them here.

Could you imagine \nthis in any developed country? As long as mining is largely dependent on \nenergy, there is no hope to break the balance/imbalance.\n\nBandwidth is probably only a few percent of miners' cost. There is no \nevidence that the current level of centralization is a result of block \nsize. Instead, clear evidence has shown that centralization is a result \nof pool mining*, invention of ASIC, and disparity of energy cost.

Unless \nBIP101/103 is adopted, adjusting the hard cap always require a hardfork. \nFor obvious technical and political reasons we can't have hardfork too \nfrequently. Therefore, we need to leave some leeway: the hard cap may be \na bit too high for today, but we are sure that technology will catch up \nin the near future.\n\nAssuming we have plenty amount of \"benevolent\" miners, they will keep \nthe block size low unless there is a real demand for larger block space. \nThis is different from setting an individual soft limit, as that will \nlead to block size scarcity and therefore higher tx fee, which may be \ngood for all miners. And as we say \"miners can always decrease the block \nsize with softfork or 51% attack\", BIP100 materializes this possibility \nin a much smoother way.\n\nI say \"lucky\" because I wholeheartedly believe it is good to keep the \nblock as small as we really need.

And \nI believe an urgent hardfork should only be done as a bug fix, not \nimplementation of a new feature. Block size increase should be a planned \nfeature, as we don't want the tx fee raised to 10USD, before suddenly \ndropping to 0.01USD with the hardfork.\n\nI don't think it's urgent today because my free tx always get mined. I \ndon't know what is urgent and different people have different \ndefinition, but in general I think that should be measured by tx fee in \nUSD. 0.001USD/byte may be intolerable for many people. (It's about \n$0.0001/byte now, and $0.0005/byte when it was $1200/BTC). It's not \ndifficult to reach this level given the halving and potential bull \nmarket is coming.\n\n> Mine is: we should consider a block increase only when minimum market\n> fees for transactions to be mined (currently zero satoshis) increase\n> above a high fee (admittedly undefined, but certainly greater than\n> zero).\n\nAs I argued above, it's already too late when things become really \nurgent. That will lead to serious market disruption, and the uncertainty \ncould be very harmful to the development of the bitcoin economy.\n\n> Even if it's \"urgent\", I think we should only increase the maximum if,\n> at the same time, the new size can be considered safe\n> mining-centralization-wise (unfortunately we don't have any metric to\n> measure that nor enough tools to realistically simulate different\n> sizes in different network topologies at the moment).

Miners\ncollaborating to release statements to the public about which BIPs they\nsupport is very different from miners incurring costs only to themselves in\norder to help the entire group. They might do so, but it isn't clear.\n\nI agree with Jorge and Mark that allowing miners to vote on the block size\nis not ideal. Miners interests are somewhat aligned with those of the\nbroader community, but not perfectly aligned. The block size level that\nmaximizes miner revenue is not necessarily desirable overall. More miner\nrevenue is only good if the marginal extra security that it buys is worth\nthe extra cost. In addition to the cost of higher user fees, there's\nanother hidden cost. In Bitcoin's early stages trying to maximize revenue\ntoo soon can slow growth and result in less revenue when it's more needed\n(when block rewards are much lower).\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150829/9386d2f4/attachment.html>"

Just consider this: 34% 8MB, 33% \n1.5MB, 33% 1.2MB\n\nI personally believe the median is the most natural and logical choice. \n51% of miners can always force the 49% to follow the simple majority \nchoice through a 51% attack. Using median will eliminate the incentive \nto 51% attack due to this reason. The incentive to 51% attack will exist \nwhen you use any value other than 50-percentile. The further it is from \n50, the bigger the incentive.\n\nHaving said that, I don't think it is an absolutely bad idea to use a \nvalue other than 50-percentile. The exact value is debatable.\n\nHowever, if you use something other than median, you should make it \nsymmetrical.

Anonymity is\nnot something we would be willing to compromise, despite the general\npublic's endless willingness to give away their intimate life histories and\ncontact details to Facebook and other social media.\n\nIf you have the will to read a longish response, we have tried to expand a\nlittle on the rationale for the type of data we believe will be useful and\nvaluable, in addition to broadly addressing the privacy issues.\n\nArguably, the greater the cryptographic protections on the ownership of a\ntransaction, the more value will be placed on the nature of transactions.\nWithout wishing to frame the conversation on specifics or particular\nsectors, here are some distinctions to address some of the previously noted\nOrwellian fears on attaching identity markers to Bitcoin transactions.\n\n* We have no desire to create tools that can analyze which brand of baked\nbeans Bob may prefer compared to Alice. That is a matter of extreme detail\nfor supermarkets, their suppliers and internal point of sale systems.  When\nyou make a store purchase, your basket of goods are wrapped up in a single\npayment which appears on your credit card or bank statement. Knowing on an\naggregated basis that people spend around $120 / week on retail shopping\nand that Saturday is the busiest period for that activity is more valuable\nfor payment processors than knowing the contents of Bob's basket of goods.\n\nAs a retailer or supplier, I would buy that data in order to plan\ninventory, marketing budgets, promotional activity, staffing levels,\nlogistics, factory production, bank borrowing, store expansion planning,\netc.\n\n* Now consider petrol. Bitcoin is very well suited for fuel purchases,\nespecially for small independent petrol filling stations. Aggregated data\nwould help the entire supply chain that serves the consumer, if businesses\nat the front end had access to data for when demand was at peaks and\ntroughs. Extend that from individual petrol stations to regional, national\nand international consumer purchases and you have the basis of the market\npricing oil based on demand per period and per country. Again, we don't\ncare that it is actually Bob who fills up every Sunday so he has enough\nfuel to last him the week or to track him along his driving holiday.\n\n* Now consider remittances. While the global headlines are that it is a\n$500bn a year industry. Few people know that remittances are based on a\nrelatively small number of remittance corridors that make up the bulk of\nthe market.  These corridors are based around people leaving small towns\nand villages in poor areas and travelling to work in locations based on\nknowing someone or a family member who used to live in their area and are\ndoing well in xyz location because they can see the beneficial impact on\nthe recipients quality of life. At the coal face, remittances are a word of\nmouth grey market sector and part of the reason that WU and the like can\ncharge so much is because the last mile of remittances are in areas where\nmonetary infrastructure and logistics are difficult to serve and they can\nget away with setting high prices. They prosper because they use data to\norganise themselves better. Banks have no desire to serve this market\nbecause you end up clogging up branches every Friday or Saturday with\npeople that transact relatively small sums compared to those that are\nbanked and get annoyed waiting. Having access to Bitcoin transaction data\non this sector would help Bitcoin businesses to understand the end points\nof this market and serve it better and focus their promotional activities.\nWe have no desire to identify that Bob's cousin Jos\u00e9 is working illegally\nin Texas.\n\nThese are three sectors where there are millions of small businesses that\nwould, for the first time, be able to access global, national and regional\nindustry data figures typically reserved for large businesses due to the\nhigh cost of acquiring or commissioning research.\n\nWhile increasing anonymity or having zero knowledge proofs in transactions\nis desirable so that I can keep my Bitcoin salary payments private and my\nmembership of Ashley Madison out of the news, it would be helpful to know\nthat when I want to spend my salary that the world around me is organised\nenough to serve my needs.\n\nThe block chain is ledger. It will contain a global data set that could end\nup being one of the most valuable databases in the world. Why not use it to\nfund Bitcoin's security infrastructure and growing bandwidth challenges?\n\nRegards,\n\nAhmed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Aug 23, 2015 at 5:05 PM, Adam Back <adam at cypherspace.org> wrote:\n\n> Some comments:\n>\n> \"(i) remove any possibility of free transactions unless\n>\n> associated with basic transaction data;\"\n>\n> I believe it is not possible to prevent free transactions for the\n> reason that people can pay out of band (via existing banking transfers\n> to miners) or make payments to addresses belonging to miners (that are\n> contingent on the requested user transaction being processed via input\n> dependency) .\n>\n>\n> I am not sure I fully understand the way you see monetisation working,\n> and you do indicate this is quite far future what-if stage idea, and\n> you do identify a conflict with fungibility - but I think this is\n> probably quite badly in conflict with fungibility to the point of\n> conflicting with many planned Bitcoin improvements?

Depending only on previous block size calculation.\n\nii. Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx fee\ncollected by miners.\n\n==Motivation==\n\nWith increased adoption, transaction volume on bitcoin network is\nbound to grow. If the one megabyte max cap is not changed to a\nflexible one which changes itself with changing network demand, then\nadoption will hamper and bitcoin's growth may choke up. Following\ngraph shows the change in average block size since inception...\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=\n\n==Specification==\n\n===Proposal 1 : Depending only on previous block size calculation===\n\n  If more than 50% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the\nlast difficulty period, is more than 90% MaxBlockSize\n      Double MaxBlockSize\n  Else if more than 90% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of\nthe last difficulty period, is less than 50% MaxBlockSize\n      Half MaxBlockSize\n  Else\n      Keep the same MaxBlockSize\n\n===Proposal 2 : Depending on previous block size calculation and\nprevious Tx fee collected by miners===\n\n  TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty = Sum of all Block size of\nfirst 2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period\n  TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty = Sum of all Block size of second\n2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period (This actually includes 8\nblocks from last but one difficulty)\n\n  TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of first 2008\nblocks in last 2 difficulty period\n  TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of second 2008\nblocks in last 2 difficulty period (This actually includes 8 blocks\nfrom last but one difficulty)\n\n  If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty\nperiod)/4016 > 50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty >\nTotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) AND (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty\n> TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) )\n      MaxBlockSize = TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty * MaxBlockSize /\nTotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty\n  Else If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty\nperiod)/4016 < 50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty <\nTotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) AND (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty\n< TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) )\n      MaxBlockSize = TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty * MaxBlockSize /\nTotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty\n  Else\n      Keep the same MaxBlockSize\n\n==Rationale==\n\nThese two proposals have been derived after discussion on\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1154536.0 BitcoinTalk] and\n[http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010285.html\nbitcoin-dev mailing list]. The original idea and its evolution in the\nlight of various arguements can be found\n[http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php here].\n\n===Proposal 1 : Depending only on previous block size calculation===\n\nThis solution is derived directly from the indication of the problem.\nIf transaction volume increases, then we will naturally see bigger\nblocks. On the contrary, if there are not enough transaction volume,\nbut maximum block size is high, then only few blocks may sweep the\nmempool. Hence, if block size is itself taken into consideration, then\nmaximum block size can most rationally be derived.

An equivalent process for Bitcoin would be that the max block-size limit (and other fundamental economic parameters) would be determined via a process of forking off altcoins (such as Bitcoin XT will do) and allowing the market to decide which coin is most valuable.

I do not oppose opening up the determination of the max block-size limit to a popular \"check\" via stakeholder vote \u2014 actually, I think this is an important check on miners' power \u2014 but I do argue that the vote is likely to have drastically little participation and very low-quality results.\n\n[1] Rational Ignorance: \u00abIgnorance about an issue is said to be \"rational\" when the cost of educating oneself about the issue sufficiently to make an informed decision can outweigh any potential benefit one could reasonably expect to gain from that decision, and so it would be irrational to waste time doing so.\u00bb <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance>"

There's a scale at\nwhich the minimum CPU costs for a miner to be competitive may be so\nhigh that some small miners without the resources to meet that minimum\nwill become unprofitable.\nAdmittedly we're not near that scale yet, but if something to take into account.\n\n> The main critique to uncapped max blocksizes which I've heard stems from our\n> incapacity to quantify the advantages that large miners have over smaller\n> ones.\n\nThere are some simulations. See:\nhttp://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners\n\nThe goal of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6382 is to allow\npeople to do more realistic simulations (by using real full nodes).\nThat doesn't mean that more simplified simulations are worthless, but\nI didn't want people to have to create their own testchain every time\nthey want to simulate a different size, like rusty had to do for:\n\nhttp://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=509\n\nSo the \"incapacity to quantify the advantages that large miners have\nover smaller ones\" doesn't really exist.\nIt would be nice to have more data about this (more sizes, more\nnetwork topologies, etc) though.\n\n> As I will show in an upcoming paper, these advantages do not stem from\n> the act of propagating large blocks but rather from the block subsidies\n> which allow miners to mine unnecessary large blocks irregardless of the fees\n> contained therein.

All arguments invoking rates\n> of technological advances (see Gavin's original posts) don't mean anything.\n\nI really dislike basing the consensus rules on predictions about\nfuture technology. For all I know, a terrible war could destroy half\nof the global internet infrastructure in the next 5 years.\nI prefer simpler increments like in bip102 (although I don't have the\ndata to know if 2MB is safe mining-centralization-wise at this point\n[when mining centralization is pretty bad]).\nArguments against that kind of change are usually along the lines\n\"then we will have to repeat this same discussion in 1 or 2 years\".\nI believe that with the proper simulation tools being deployed and a\nbetter general understanding of what the concerns are, the\nconversation should be much simpler the next time.\n\n> Rational miners will NOT be incentivized to mine gargantuan spam filled\n> blocks in the presence of a vanishing block reward.\n\nActually some simulations show they in fact have incentive to do just\nthat in some cases.\nBut more importantly, we shouldn't assume that all attackers are\nrational miners. Maybe a potential attacker is a secret service or a\nfinancial cartel attempting to destroy Bitcoin for whatever reason.\n\n> I truly hope this matter gets the consideration it deserves. Particularly\n> with the upcoming scaling workshops.\n\nI truly hope that the discussion can move forward into more productive\nterritories after the workshop, and I'm particularly interested in\nPeter R's presentation, even if I haven't found the time to read his\npaper yet. Even if fees are not the main reason why we want to have a\nblock size maximum, fees are certainly very relevant and anything that\nhe has mathematically proven in that regard will be useful to this\ndiscussion.\n\n> On Aug 21, 2015 11:35 PM, \"Daniele Pinna\" <daniele.pinna at gmail.com> wrote:\n>\n> \"I ran some simulations, and if blocks take 20 seconds to propagate, a\n> network with a miner that has 30% of the hashing power will get 30.3% of the\n> blocks.\"\n>\n> Peter_R's analysis of fee markets in the absence of blocksize limits [1]\n> shows that the hashrate advantage of a large miner is a side-effect of\n> coinbase subsidization.

It is important for bitcoin community to realise the responsibility to put a control on such elements and at the same time uphold the values of bitcoin's decentralised and democratic money system. The same applies for transactions orgininating to or from such sanctioned countries.\n\n\n==Specification==\nTo counter this problem, an bitcoin account can be centrally created in control and/or oversight of Bitcoin Foundation which should be allowed to do 0-sum transactions with a Memo Flag of BLOCK or ALLOW. And empty memo transaction has no impact. And this should be considered in consensus protocol for transaction confirmation, to BLOCK or ALLOW transactions in an account if the immediate previous transaction is BLOCK or ALLOW in that account, respectively.\n\n==Rationale==\nThe Bitcoin Foundation will act as fair play party and enforcement body to control the misuse of vast financial powers which bitcoin has. The BLOCK and ALLOW is end action of a possible upstream review process for every account on the bitcoin network. The freedom of unchecked mining, poses a certain threat today and even bigger threats in future.\nEven if someone is BLOCKed due to certain clerical mistakes, the process has ALLOW functionality. And if law enforcement comes with more substantial reasons of BLOCKing an account, the same be done multiple times.\nWe are a world of human beings with rationale, who have abilities to talk, listen and communicate. Therefore, a human to human touch can never be negated in however powerful computerisation.\n\n==Backward compatibility==\nThe new consensus protocol could seem unfavourable to some due to many reasons. After listening to all parties, even if some nodes would opt to stay in old protocol, they won't be able to join the new protocol ever. This would be a hard fork and natural cleanup of bitcoin protocol from illicit miners and users.\n\n==Implementation==\nThe implementation is in progress. The detail code will be shared soon.\n\n==Acknowledgements==\nIt is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.- Mahatma Gandhi"

Clearly, when one country unilaterally places\npoliticians of another country on banned lists and vice versa, for example,\nwould create some problems with implementation and automating checks\nagainst banned lists produced by each country.\n\nWhile you could apply a 'home rule' approach, you would be pushing\nregulatory controls down to individuals transacting between each other\nwithout having to go through any regulated intermediaries. This means you\nhave no way to enforce KYC or verify that the details are correct unless\nyou create a system of third party checkers in each country who would\nenable transactions to proceed.

They check bank accounts before they \nopen your account and they link your Bitcoin address to your account in \ntheir database.  Then they ask for an explanation of why you are using \nthe account.  Then they track your coins to a certain extent once you \nactually buy Bitcoins.  None of these activities are directly involving \nthe protocol or would require changes to the Bitcoin system.\n\nWhat you can do is develop standards for using Bitcoin and entities that \nneed to follow AML-KYC can choose to follow those standards if they want \nwhen they conduct business using Bitcoin.  You can add a small amount of \nextraneous data to transactions that could show you followed some \nAML-KYC procedure.  If you did that you could have a \"white list\" of \ncomplaint transactions rather than a \"black list\" of non-compliant \ntransactions as you seem to be proposing.  I am not sure how you would \nactually do something like that or how it would work but it is an \ninteresting concept (not necessarily good, but interesting).\n\nRuss"

Though I've honestly\nnot read those in depth either. With that said, I was driving\nthe other day and thought of a potential idea. I'll be clear, this is\njust an idea, and I haven't fully fleshed it out. But I thought I'd\nthrow it out there and see what people thought.\n\nMy Goal:\n\nProvide a variable block size that provides for sustainable, long-term\ngrowth, and balances the block propagation, while also being mindful\nof potential spam attacks.\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nEvery 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks, at the same time the\ndifficulty is adjusted), the new block size parameters are calculated.\n\nThe calculation determines the average (mean) size of the past 2016\nblocks. This \"average\" size is then doubled (200%) and used as the\nmaximum block size for the subsequent 2016 blocks. At any point, if\nthe new maximum size is calculated to be below 1MB, 1MB is used\ninstead (which prevents regression from our current state).\n\nIntroduce a block minimum, the minimum will be 25% of the current\nmaximum, calculated at the same time (that is, every 2016 blocks, at\nthe same time the maximum is calculated). All blocks must be at least\nthis size in order to be valid, for blocks that do not have enough\ntransactions to meet the 25%, padding will be used. This devalues the\nincentive to mine empty blocks in either an attempt to deflate the\nblock size, or to obtain a propagation advantage. Miners will be\nincentivized to include transactions, as the block must meet the\nminimum. This should ensure that even miners wishing to always mine\nthe minimum are still confirming Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAt the block in which this is introduced the maximum would stay at 1MB\nfor the subsequent 2016 blocks. With the minimum being enforced of 256KB\n.\n\nExample:\n\n    * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks: 724KB\n    * New Maximum: 1448KB\n    * New Minimum: 362KB\n\nExample: (Regression Prevention)\n\n    * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks: 250KB\n    * New Maximum: 1MB\n    * New Minimum: 256KB\n\nThe Future:\n\nI believe that the 1MB regression prevention might need to be changed\nin the future, to prevent a large mining population from continually\ndeflating the block size (and keeping us at the 1MB limit).\n\nFor this, the hard limit could be changed in the future manually,\nthrough a process similar to the current one, though hopefully with\nfar less urgency and hysteria.\n\nAnother option is to add an additional calculation, preventing the new\nmaximum from being lower than 75% of the current maximum. This would\nsubstantially slow down a block-size deflation attack.\n\n Example of Block-Size Deflation Attack Prevention:\n\n * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks:  4MB\n * New Maximum:  8MB\n * New Minimum:  2MB\n\n * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks:  2MB\n * New Maximum:  6MB  (2 * 200% = 4, 4< 75% of 8, So use 8 * .75 = 6)\n * New Minimum:  1.5MB\n\nThis would provide a maximum growth of 200% per recalculation, but a\nmaximum shrinkage of 75%.\n\nRequest For Comments:\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts. Why wouldn't this work? What portion\nis flawed? Will the miners support such a proposal? Would this even\nsolve the block size issue?\n\nI will note that I don't find the 100% and 25% to be hard and fast in\nmy idea. Those we're just the values that initially jumped out at me.\nI could easily see the minimum being anything below 50% (above 50% and\nthe network can never adjust to smaller block sizes). I could also see\nthe maximum being anything over 100%.  Lastly, if a inflation attack\nis a valid concern, a hard upper limit could be set (or the historical\n32MB limit could remain).\n\nI think the great part about this variable approach is that the\nnetwork can adjust to address spikes in volume and readjust once those\nspikes dissipate.\n\n- -- \nThanks!\n\n- -----\nJustin M.

The\npropagation time of a block across the whole network (or even to the\nminer's sub-network) will always depend on the concrete network\ntopology.\n\nThat's not to say that transmitting a block between to peers in\nconstant time wouldn't greatly help with mining centralization\nconcerns related the maximum block size, but I'm concerned about this\nincorrect \"O(1) block propagation\" meme keeps spreading.\nEven with ansibles [1] and safe zk-SNARKS [2] for constant time block\nvalidation (somehow removing the trusted setup), both of which are\nscience fiction right now you need to verify the snark proof for every\nnode receiving and relaying the block.\nAt that point block propagation would be meaningless as a\nminer-centralization concern for not raising the maximum block size\nthough: the minimum CPU costs for being able to mine profitably would\nbe the next concern or \"bottleneck\".\n\nI completely agree with the minimum block size being inappropriate\nthough. I don't even believe that the stated goals of the size minimum\ncan be accomplished with it.\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible\n[2] https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879.pdf"

Blockchain explorers can apply the same\ndisambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search\nbox.\n\n>From the point of view of a wallet developer (or other tool that need to\nshow any kind of Blockchain references), using this scheme mean that he\ncan simply make it a blockchain: link and be done with it, without having\nto worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the\nuser to select one.\n\nBlockchain explorers in turn will simply offer to handle the blockchain:\nURI, the first time the user visit their website, or launch/install the\napplication, or even set themselves if there isn't already one.\n\nUsers get the convenience of using always their preferred explorer, which\ncan be especially handy on mobile devices, where juggling with cut&paste\nis far from ideal.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150829/2c19c922/attachment.html>"

First, using a real URI scheme, blockchain:// so that we can just use normal URL parsing libraries. The bitcoin: thing leads to additional code to mutate it into a proper URI before passing it to URL parsing. And I think it would be fine to include the type looking up. For example:\n\nblockchain://blockhash/00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198\nblockchain://txid/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a\nblockchain://block/189000\nblockchain://address/1RicMooMWxqKczuRCa5D2dnJaUEn9ZJyn\n\nI think this would help the URI be more human understandable as well as give the explorers the ability to optimize a bit what they are looking for when hitting various databases.\n\nA possible future path could also include blockchain://tx/123000/4 for block height, tx index... Another possibility could be blockchain://version which would return a list of supported paths, version of the BIP supported, etc.\n\nThe BIP should also specify little endian searching. I'm not sure, but would it also make sense for this BIP to include what the return results should look like?

FTC\ncould move their genesis block to the next block (or the first one that is\nnot identical to LTC's).\n\nBitcoin and all its test chains have different genesis blocks, so I'm not\nsure FTC should be a concern for a BIP anyway...\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150830/bbc89393/attachment.html>"

The work proceeds, in a sense, from where Peter R's\nwork left off correcting a mistake and addressing the critiques made by the\ncommunity to his work.\n\nThe main result of the work is a detailed analysis of mining advantages\n(defined as the added profit per unit of hash) as a function of miner\nhashrate. In it, I show how large block subsidies (or better, low mempool\nfees-to-subsidy ratios) incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to\nthe steady increasing of marginal profits as hashrates grow.\n\nThe paper also shows that part of the large advantage the large miners have\ntoday is due to there being a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency\nmining class which has access to expected profits an order of magnitude\nlarger than everyone else. As block subsidies decrease, this\nhigh-efficiency class is expected to vanish leading to a marginal profit\nstructure which decreases as a function of hashrate.\n\nThis work has vacuumed my entire life for the past two weeks leading me to\nlag behind on a lot of work. I apologize for typos which I may not have\nseen. I stand by for any comments the community may have and look forward\nto reigniting consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101)\nwhich, due to the XT fork drama, I believe has been placed hastily and\nundeservedly on the chopping block.\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/276849939/On-the-Nature-of-Miner-Advantages-in-Uncapped-Block-Size-Fee-Markets\n\nRegards,\nDaniele\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150829/527d1332/attachment.html>"

You have some 1400+ bytes to work with before you\nnotice the increase in information in relay cost.

Let's\nignore the relay network entirely for now. Several miners have nodes\nwell distributed all over the globe which peer either directly with\nother miners in the area, or just connect to a ton of nodes, probably\nhitting other miners. The cost to transmit from their pool server to\ntheir relay server is one packet, always. They pre-relay everything\nthey're gonna include, so, at max, they might have to pick between a few\npre-relayed blocks (what, like, 2/5 bits?).

But you respond to dpinna agreeing with him and not cautioning him on relying on these\n> \nThe proof is not \"problematic.\"  Right now you're providing an example of what Mike Hearn refers to as \"black-and-white\" thinking.  Just because the proof makes simplifying assumptions, doesn't mean it's not useful in helping us to understand the dynamics of the transaction fee market.  Proofs about physical systems need to make simplifying assumptions because the physical world is messy (unlike the world of pure math).  \n\nMy proof assumes very reasonably that block solutions contain information (i.e., Shannon Entropy) about the transactions included in a block.  As long as this is true, and as long as miners act rationally to maximize their profit, then the fee market will remain \"healthy\" according to the definitions given in my paper.  This is the case right now, this is the case with the Relay Network, and this would be the case using any implementation of IBLTs that I can imagine, so long as miners retain the ability to construct blocks according to their own volition.  The \"healthy fee market\" result follows from the Shannon-Hartley theorem; the SH-theorem describes the maximum rate at which information (Shannon Entropy) can be transmitted over a physical communication channel.   \n\nYou are imagining an academic scenario (to use your own words: \"perhaps of little practical relevance\") where all of the block solutions announcements contain no information at all about the transactions included in the blocks.  Although I agree that the fee market would not be healthy in such a scenario, it is my feeling that this also requires miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks according to their own volition (i.e., the system would already be centralized).  I look forward to reading a white paper where you show:\n\n(a) Under what assumptions/requirements such a communication scheme is physically possible.\n\n(b) That such a configuration is not equivalent to a single entity[1] controlling >50% of the hash power.\n\n(c) That the network moving into such a configuration is plausible.\n\nLastly, I'd like to conclude by saying that we are all here trying to learn about this new amazing thing called Bitcoin.  Please go ahead and write a paper that shows under what network configuration my results don't hold.  I'd love to read it!  This is how we make progress in science!!\n\nSincerely, \nPeter\n\n[1] For example, if--in order to achieve such a configuration with infinite coding gain--miners can no longer choose how to structure their blocks according to their own volition, then I would classify those miners as slaves rather than as peers, and the network as already centralized.\n\n\nLink to forwarded email pastebin: http://pastebin.com/jFgkk8M3\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150829/d27a316e/attachment-0001.html>"

A result was that the other\nauthor's work may require significant revisions.\n\nI complained about this to you, again privately, and your (apparent)\nresponse was to post to that thread stating that there was a\ndetails-unspecified academic disagreement with me and \"I look forward\nto a white paper demonstrating otherwise!\", in direct contradiction to\nyour remarks to me three weeks ago in private correspondence: In private\nyou said that your model may only hold in an asymptotic sense and that\n\"the phenomena in the paper (may) be negligible compared to the dynamics\nfrom some other effect\"; but in public you said /my/ position was\n\"academic\".\n\nAt this point I thought continuing to withhold this information from\nthe other author was unreasonable and no longer justified by courtesy\nto you, and I forwarded our complete discussion to the other author\nwith the comment \"I'll forward you a set of private correspondence\nthat I've had with Peter R.

In that\nparticular case it knows it because it selected it to begin with, but\nthe same behavior holds if the hasher selects the transaction set and\nsends it first.\n\nIt only _very_ weakly reflects how the relay protocol works (only the\nselection and permutation is communicated; not the transaction data\nitself; for already known transactions). Even if you assume nothing\nmore than that (in spite of the existing reality) you have not shown\nthat the compressed data must be linear in the size of the block.\n\nIt does not reflect how P2Pool works (which also sends the\ntransactions in advance).\n\nThere is a simple, and intuitive understanding that does not require\nany complex supposition:  You argue that the information must be\ntransfered when a block is found, thus delaying it.  I point out, no,\nany required information (to the extent that there is any at all after\nefficient encoding) can be sent in advance of the block.\n\nI believe that you've allowed the fact that the specifc example block\nrelay protocol doesn't bother sending _all_ information in advance to\nconfuse it for mere compression.\n\n> My public comments have been factual.

The result\nbeing that the behavior you're describing would only be asymptoic and\nhave no relationship to the actual Bitcoin system that exists in a\nfinite universe.\n\nBut you continue to demand debate over this meaningless point.\n\n> I'll end by saying that I am the one describing things as the presently are.\n> You are talking about a hypothetical future that may or may not exist (and\n> may not even be possible).

Even in this messsage you defend\nignoring of centeralization considerations in your paper. But here ask\nthat I address concerns which you refused to suggest. Why do you\ndemand my correction use weaker assumptions than your work?\n\nThat said-- I already gave you a fairly concrete description of a\npratical protocol which would accomplish your requirement ( (a) reduce\nthe information transmitted in a latency critical way at block\ndiscovery time to O(1) network wide, (b) without creating\ncenteralization in chain or transaction selection). I believe my\ndescription in the messages was adequate that anyone working on\nBitcoin Core could go implement a version of it, at least.  You appear\nto have simply ignrored it.\n\nIf the actual technical details made your eyes glaze over I also\noffered a simple intutive understanding:  The no proportional\ninformation need be transfered at the latency critical time, because\nit can be transfered in _advance_. Everything beyond that is just\nefficiency optimizations to reduce the cost of doing the advanced\ntransmission.\n\n> (c) That the network moving into such a configuration is plausible.\n\nThat it already uses advanced information techniques in every widely\nused mining protocol, that the relay protocol was rapidly adopted, and\nthat your own model would suggest significant profits from any such\nimprovement would seem to remove any doubt related to (c)... and again\nhere you hold me to a higher bar than your own work: as nowhere do you\nshow that the \"limits\" your model erroniously extracts are plausable\nas limits, and in private you seemed to admit to me that they may well\nnot be."

I say prove it: show rigorously what the network would look like in a case where information about the transactions contained in a block is never communicated with the block solution.  How do you get the miners to agree (assuming such a configuration is even physically possible)?  Do you need all the miners to agree or only a portion of them?  How reasonable is it that the systems moves into such a configuration?  I know you spoke to this in your last response, but I mean really prove it...with a mathematical model, with diagrams and charts, with equations, with your assumptions clearly stated so that they can be put to the test--not by waving your hands on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.    \n\nThis is an exciting field of research and we should encourage people to continue to explore these questions.   \n\n> this point would make the\n> take away of your work not \"a healthy transaction fee market exists\n> without a block size limit\" but rather \"a decenteralized bitcoin\n> cannot exist\"-- as, accepting the other errors as fact your model\n> shows that centralizing mining is always strictly more profitable at\n> any level of fee demand; because your model equivilent shows that for\n> any level of fee demand and gamma miners could increase their income\n> by centeralizing further.\n\nOK, I actually sort of agree with your very last sentence above.  My paper indeed suggests that the most \"profitable\" configuration is one where there is only one \"super pool.\" Is that likely to happen?  I personally don't think so because of the game theory involved.  But regardless of my opinion or your opinion on that matter, whether it is or isn't likely to happen is outside the scope of my paper.  It is irrelevant to the result that a fee market exists without a block size limit given the assumption that there is more than a single miner.\n\n> I absolutely agree that simplifications are useful and essential, but\n> it is critically important to call them out before someone mistakes\n> theoretical work as useful motivation for policy in the non-simplified\n> system.\n\nI do call them out.  Furthermore, I've already agreed with you to further clarify these assumptions when I make the other corrections to the paper.  Doing so will make the paper stronger.  \n\nI'm not going to address the remainder of your email because I believe that we are now talking past each other.  I do appreciate the interest and attention that you've paid to my work on the Transaction Fee Market, and I also recognize the important contributions you've made such as coinjoin and HD wallets.  \n\nBest regards,\nPeter\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150830/a8607804/attachment.html>"

In spite of being the\nsole entity creating the blockchain there would still be many actions\nthey could *not* do:\n\n* Falsify ECDSA signatures\n* Generate proof of work without expending energy\n* Produce blocks that non-mining nodes would recognize as including\ninvalid transactions (including printing themselves unlimited balances)\n* Force other people to purchase the coins they mine so that they can\npay their electric bills\n\nWhat they *can* do is:\n\n* Defraud recipients of transactions by including a payment transaction\nin a block, then orphaning that block with another block that contains a\nconflicting transaction (double spend).\n\nThere is usually*** a cost to performing this attack, so miners would\nonly be expected to do it if the benefit exceeds the cost.\n\n* Prevent the inclusion of valid transactions into any block using any\ncriteria they want.\n\nThe worse case scenario for mining monopolization is that the risk of\nprofitable double spends means that transactions might require more\nconfirmations to be reliable, and that some entity can censor\ntransactions at will.\n\nThose aren't exactly end-of-the world failure cases. They are certainly\nundesirable and every means of preventing them should be investigated,\nbut it does mean that it should be possible to dial back on the\ncatastrophe language when analysing possible failure modes.\n\nThe weakest area for Bitcoin to be attacked is via censorship enforced\nby miners.\n\nThe first line of defence is to improve the privacy features of wallets\nto the point at which blacklists are not effective. I'm confident that\nthis can be achieved.\n\nThat leaves the censors with the choice of whether or not to escalate to\nwhitelisting, which ultimately can be countered by users switching to a\nnew system which does not have that particular anti-feature.\n\ntl;dr: Bitcoin security does not lie on a one-dimensional \"centralized\nvs decentralized\" axis. Treating it as if it does removes the clarity\nthat is needed in order to effectively solve problems.\n\n***Exploring the exact conditions under which this is true is an\ninteresting exercise and relevant to long term discussions vis a vis the\nblock subsidy and transaction fees in the future.\n\n-- \nJustus Ranvier\nOpen Bitcoin Privacy Project\nhttp://www.openbitcoinprivacyproject.org/\njustus at openbitcoinprivacyproject.org\nE7AD 8215 8497 3673 6D9E 61C4 2A5F DA70 EAD9 E623\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: 0xEAD9E623.asc\nType: application/pgp-keys\nSize: 18381 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150831/93275cff/attachment-0001.bin>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 801 bytes\nDesc: OpenPGP digital signature\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150831/93275cff/attachment-0001.sig>"

I will include a note about it when I make the other corrections to the Fee Market paper.\n\nI agree with what Daniele said previously.  The other \"non-greedy\" solutions to the knapsack problem are most relevant when one is choosing from a smaller number of items where certain items have a size similar to the size of the knapsack itself.  For example, these other solutions would be useful if transactions were often 50 kB, 100 kB, 400 kB in size, and we were trying to find the optimal TX set to fit into a 1 MB block.  \n\nHowever, since the average transaction size is ~500 bytes, even with a block size limit of 1 MB, we are looking at up to 2000 transactions.  The quantization effects become small.  Rather than 22 triangles as shown in Fig. 3 (http://imgur.com/rWxZddg), there are hundreds or a few thousands, and we can reasonably approximate the discrete set of points as a continuous curve.  Like Daniele pointed out, the greedy algorithm assumed in the paper is asymptotically optimal in such a case.\n\nBest regards,\nPeter\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150830/d1591a5e/attachment.html>"

I\nworry that any time (eg all time so far) the rules of that competition\nremain static, a group of people willing to develop and optimize hardware\nthat performs the work will form, and their products will find a following\n- the miners.  These miners and hardware producers will advance the\ntechnology until the cost of competing in the space is so high that mining\nbitcoin is, for all practical purposes, centralized.\n\nI propose that the proof of work algorithm be scheduled to change\nperiodically.  The current definition is pretty simple and there's no\nreason not to continue using simple definitions.  We could develop a list\nof hash algorithms which could be indexed so that the first few bits of the\ndifficulty-change block's hash (or even *every* block's hash) could be used\nto select one to be used for the next block.  The principle is to\ndiscourage specialization of hardware designed for what we must admit is an\narbitrary computing exercise, intended only to enable competition.\n\nOf course chip designers could start working on hardware that can handle\nall the algorithms defined, but the protocol can also warn them that from\ntime to time, the community will alter the content of the list of hash\nalgorithms, specifically to ensure that *general purpose *computing\nmachines (ie, what the average tech aficionado will have) is the best\ndevice for mining bitcoin.\n\nIf such a variable PoW were to be used, I recommend that most of the\nelements in the initial list of algorithms be the current PoW algorithm so\nthat most blocks can be solved by the existing mining community, and only\none every now and then will be available to everyone else.  Over time, that\nratio would fall, giving the miners time to convert their expertise into\nmore productive activities.\n\nI refer you to the stories at the beginning of each chapter of Douglas\nHofstadter's\nG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, a few of which describe a\ncompetition between a record-player-making tortoise and Achilles, who works\non making records that break the record players.  It offers some through\nprovoking musings that can easily be related to this thing Satoshi made.\n\nnotplato\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20150830/ec094004/attachment-0001.html>"

I apologize for the\nspamming.\n\nI present a theorem whose thesis is obvious to many.\n\n*THESIS: All hashrates* *h' > h generate a revenue per unit of hash v' >\nv. *\n\nLet us absurdly[1] assume that an optimal hashrate *h* exists where the\naverage revenue for each hash in service is maximized. This will result\nfrom perpetually mining blocks of size *q,* is *v. *All larger hashrates *h'\n> h* will generate an average revenue per hash *v' < v*(effectively the\nconclusion of my paper) due to the higher orphan risk carried from having\nto mine blocks of size *q' > q*. Leading from Peter's model and my\nanalysis, the origin of this balance lies in the fact that larger miners\nmust somehow be forced to mine larger blocks which in turn carry a larger\norphan risk.\n\nWhat happens if a large miner *h'* chooses not to mine his optimal block\nsize *q' *in favor of a seemingly \"sub-optimal\" block size* q*?\nSince he mines a block of identical size as the smaller miner, they will\nboth carry identical orphan risks[2], and win identical\namounts*R+M(q)* whenever\nthey successfully mine a block. Since the larger miner can statistically\nexpect to win *h'/h* more blocks than the smaller miner, they will each\nearn an identical revenue per unit of hash *R+M(q)/h*.\n\nThis however directly contradicts the assumption that an optimal hashrate\nexists beyond which the revenue per unit of hash *v' < v*if  *h' > h. *\n*Q.E.D *\n\nThis theorem in turn implies the following corollary:\n\n*COROLLARY: **The marginal profit curve is a monotonically increasing of\nminer hashrate.*\n\nThis simple theorem, suggested implicitly by Gmaxwell disproves any and all\nconclusions of my work. Most importantly, centralization pressures will\nalways be present.\n\nFurthermore,\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum\n[2] Orphan risks will actually favor the larger hashrate miner leading to\ngreater revenues per unit of hash.\n\nI thank the dev-list for its valuable time and exchange on the subject\nmatter.
